The party seeks her out during the campaign in the hopes of learning the location of the kidnapped Gundren Rockseeker\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n●\r\n\r\nAlthough Agatha is known to be capricious, the characters believe she may be willing to provide them with the information they seek, if they approach her correctly\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n●\r\n\r\nThrough negotiation or persuasion, Agatha reveals that Gundren is being held captive in Cragmaw Castle, giving the characters a clear target for their rescue mission\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\nThe sources provide no further details about Agatha's motivations, her history, or the nature of her powers. However, her role as a source of vital information highlights the importance of seeking out unconventional sources of knowledge and navigating the complexities of dealing with powerful, unpredictable beings.\r\n\r\nAgatha's willingness to aid the characters, despite her capricious nature, suggests that even beings associated with death and the supernatural can be swayed by appeals for help or offers of appropriate exchange.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Gallery\r\n![[2d8e1806-7d6e-4b7e-a459-0377e68f8ad0.webp]]\n</context_primary>\n<context_primary path=\"characters/Globeseekers 0/Hene, Paladina dell' Annientamento.md\" mtime=\"35 minutes ago\">\n---\r\nkanka_id: 1714417\r\n---\r\n\r\nHene is an Aasimar Paladin who follows the god Tyr. Her central motivation throughout the campaign is to get revenge against the Red Sashes who she believes killed her brother.\r\n\r\nHene has a strong sense of justice, honour, and duty. She is quick to act, and decisive in battle. She sees the world in black and white terms, and has little patience for those who she perceives as weak or indecisive. This brings her into conflict with Grogo, the cleric of Ilmater, who preaches forgiveness and compassion, even for one’s enemies. She eventually learns that forgiveness is sometimes possible, although she still believes in punishing the guilty.\r\n\r\nHene’s player has opted for a “Giant” character design. This means that Yilvina can cast the Enlarge/Reduce spell on Hene, allowing her to grow to a huge size during combat.\r\n\r\nHene fights with a magical hammer called the Moonbane. This hammer was forged by the party in the Wave Echo Cave. It contains the soul of her brother, giving it special powers against lycanthropes.\r\n\r\nHene often makes sarcastic or witty remarks, especially to Bungo Dudo. She is not afraid to stand up for herself, and is always ready for a fight. Although she is sometimes impatient with Bungo Dudo’s scholarly explanations, she eventually recognises that he can be helpful.\r\n\r\nDespite her tough exterior, Hene is deeply affected by the loss of her brother. She eventually accepts that he is gone, and learns to find peace without revenge. At the end of the campaign, Hene remains dedicated to her god Tyr, and continues to fight for justice in Baldur’s Gate.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Gallery\r\n![[9d6b0256-bbbe-4936-b4a4-c535a46ed06a.webp]]\r\n![[8b9c8d68-9c96-457a-94ab-43ab3511b70b.png]]\n</context_primary>\n</context>"},{"type":"text","text":"is this a local ai?"}]}]},"responses":[],"chat_model":{"platform_key":"ollama"}},"key":"Untitled Chat 1751185645967-1751185664605","thread_key":"Untitled Chat 1751185645967","stream":true,"class_name":"SmartCompletion","context_key":"1751185655528","user_message":"is this a local ai?","new_user_message":true},
