Apela is a courtesan living in the village of Halendos. She uses her profession to gather information and secrets from influential travellers passing through the region  
.  
Beyond this basic description, the sources provide limited information about Apela's personality, motivations, or role in the larger narrative. However, her involvement in the events surrounding Dr. Godfrey's murder suggests a more complex and potentially significant role:  
●  
Suspect in a Murder Mystery: Apela was a key suspect in the investigation into Dr. Godfrey's death  
. She was Godfrey's secret lover and had access to Silver Fang venom, the poison that killed him.  Furthermore, a note reading "Cooked with love, Apela" was found beside the poisoned chicken in Godfrey's house. While Apela claims to have been kidnapped and taken to a vampire's mausoleum, she admits to feeling anger towards Godfrey, although her memories of that time are hazy  
.  
●  
A Collector of Poisons: Apela possesses a collection of poisons, including Silver Fang venom, which was stolen from her home  
. This suggests an interest in toxins and potentially dangerous substances, raising questions about her knowledge of poisons and their uses.  
●  
Victim of Manipulation?  Apela's confused memories and claims of being kidnapped suggest she may have been manipulated or used by others.  The theft of the Silver Fang venom from her collection and the framing note left at Godfrey's house could indicate someone sought to implicate her in the doctor's murder.  
Unanswered Questions:  
●  
What was the true nature of Apela's relationship with Dr. Godfrey? Was it genuine affection, a means to gather information, or something more sinister?  
●  
Did Apela play any role in Godfrey's death, whether intentionally or unintentionally? Could her hazy memories be a genuine psychological effect or a calculated act of deception?  
●  
Who kidnapped Apela and took her to the vampire's mausoleum, and what was their purpose in doing so? Was it connected to Godfrey's murder, or part of a separate scheme?  
Apela's Potential Significance: Apela, despite her limited presence in the sources, represents a point of intrigue within the narrative. Uncovering her true motivations, her knowledge of events surrounding Godfrey's death, and her connection to potential manipulators could shed light on the hidden agendas and power dynamics operating within Halendos and the surrounding region.
