Whispers on the winds and fragmented scrolls hidden in the deepest vaults of Damara tell of a terrible daemon, Akrazul the Whispering Tyrant, sealed beneath the mountains by the ancestors of the witch-hunters. Unlike many of its brethren, Akrazul was not summoned to our world; it was born in the Abyss, a place of eternal chaos and unending conflict. This daemon's imprisonment speaks to a time before Damara's witch-hunters honed their skills against summoned fiends, a time when their ancestors faced threats from beyond the veil of reality. Legend claims that Akrazul sought to exploit the rich veins of ore found in the region, twisting the metals to create weapons of unearthly power for its own legions. It was this ambition that led to its downfall. The ancestors of Damara, wielding a combination of primordial magic and dwarven craftsmanship, forged chains capable of binding Akrazul's essence to the earth. These chains were not merely physical restraints; they were imbued with enchantments that severed Akrazul's connection to the Abyssal energies that fueled its power.

Over centuries, Akrazul has whispered from its prison, seeking a soul desperate enough to break its chains. It believes that entities like the Aboleth Patron, with his desire to reshape reality, possess the power to free it. Akrazul's powers are said to be insidious, reflecting its Abyssal origins. It can warp minds, planting seeds of discord and turning allies against each other. Its whispers can manifest as physical illusions, creating visions of false hope or terrifying nightmares to break the will of its enemies. The daemon's connection to Khaldarin is twofold. First, it is believed that Akrazul's prison lies beneath the dwarven city itself, making the city a focal point for its whispers. Second, the daemon's ambition to exploit the region's resources suggests a deeper connection to the earth's essence, possibly mirroring the dwarven reverence for metal and craftsmanship.
