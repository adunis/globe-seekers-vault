Lidia is [character:6751878]'s sister. She was kidnapped from Grogo's village by the Cult of the Broken Chain when they raided it, searching for the Globe Netherese. The Cult intends to use the Globe Netherese to transform Lidia into a living artifact by implanting it in place of her heart. Grogo feels responsible for Lidia's kidnapping, as his accidental activation of the Globe is what attracted the Red Wizards of Thay to the village. When the adventuring party confronts the Cult in the Wave Echo Cave, Lidia is lying on an altar, asleep. She is rescued by the adventuring party when they disrupt the ritual. Lidia then joins Bungo Dudo's research team, traveling with him around the world and assisting him in his work. She secretly harbours romantic feelings for Bungo Dudo.
