Morun Tag: The Ambitious Derro Engineer

Morun Tag is a derro, a subterranean race known for their insanity and malevolent tendencies. However, Morun breaks this stereotype, exhibiting cunning, ambition, and a knack for engineering and invention. The sources reveal the following key aspects of his character:

●

Skilled Engineer and Inventor: Morun possesses a wide range of skills, including engineering, alchemy, carpentry, and sculpture. These talents make him a highly capable inventor and trap builder, evident in his creation of various devices, including explosives, poison canisters, and a portal to the Plane of Limbo

.

●

Entrepreneurial Spirit: Morun leverages his engineering skills for personal gain, establishing a successful business selling magical items

. He demonstrates business acumen, negotiating deals, managing agents, and seeking opportunities to expand his operations. His ambition extends beyond material wealth, driving him to acquire power and influence within the criminal underworld

.

●

Pragmatic and Opportunistic: Morun prioritises his own goals and readily adapts to changing circumstances

. He seizes opportunities for profit, even if it means aligning himself with morally ambiguous factions. His pragmatism is evident in his willingness to relocate his business to the Plane of Limbo, capitalising on the chaotic environment and its unique properties

.

●

Former Player Character: Based on your conversation history, Morun Tag was previously a player character in a D&D campaign before becoming an NPC within the narrative. This transition suggests a complex backstory and potentially evolving motivations.

●

Ambiguous Morality: Morun's actions blur the lines between good and evil. While he assists the adventurers on occasion, his motivations often stem from self-interest. His use of goblin slaves and his association with criminal organisations raise questions about his ethical boundaries.

●

Connection to B.B. and Korgak: The sources highlight Morun's association with B.B. and Korgak, two other prominent characters in the narrative. He considers B.B. an old friend and provides them with support, albeit often for a price

. His interactions with Korgak are more transactional, offering assistance and information in exchange for favours or potential profits

.

Morun Tag represents a complex and intriguing character who defies typical derro stereotypes. His engineering prowess, entrepreneurial spirit, and adaptable nature make him a force to be reckoned with. While his motivations may be shrouded in self-interest, his actions often intersect with the adventurers' paths, making him a significant figure in the unfolding events.
