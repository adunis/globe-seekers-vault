**Queen Isolde the Frost Empress** (White Dragon): Isolde reigns over the icy realms of the north, embodying the unforgiving chill of winter. As a queen of the Wyrmclaw, she commands blizzards and frost, unleashing devastating cold upon Akanul's forces. Her pristine scales reflect the auroras, and her piercing gaze can freeze the bravest of warriors in their tracks. Isolde's mastery over ice and snow makes her a strategic powerhouse, capable of immobilizing enemies and creating impassable barriers.

Queen Isolde the Frost Empress commands a vast army of drakes—wingless dragons of various types—over which she reigns as the supreme Pack Leader. Her unique ability to foster and lead these creatures stems from her deep connection to the magic of the frozen north. Isolde's domain lies in the icy expanses of northern Faerûn, where the relentless cold and treacherous terrain serve both as her fortress  testament to her power. Despite the great distance separating her realm from the southern territories, she remains a steadfast ally of the Wyrmclaw Empire. This alliance is forged through mutual ambition and a shared reverence for dragonkind, allowing them to coordinate strategies that span the breadth of Faerûn. Together, they pose a formidable threat to any who would oppose their dominion over the land and skies.
