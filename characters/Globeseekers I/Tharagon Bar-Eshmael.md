**Tharagon the Unconquerable** is the formidable leader of the Wyrmclaw, a powerful alliance of dragons intent on expanding their dominion over the skies of Faerûn. As a three-headed dragon and an avatar of Tiamat—the Goddess of Hurricanes, Sovereignty, and Self-Reliance—Tharagon embodies the relentless ambition and elemental fury of his divine patron. Under his command, the Wyrmclaw wages a bitter war against Akanul, the Genasi nation, disrupting trade routes and seizing powerful artifacts to tip the balance of power. Tharagon's strategic brilliance and indomitable will make him a nearly unstoppable force, feared by both allies and enemies alike.

**Tharagon the Unconquerable** favors a unique human form, appearing as three separate yet inseparable figures: a man, a woman, and a child, each embodying one of his elemental aspects. This form requires the three to remain physically close, symbolizing the unity and balance of his divided nature. Together, they share one consciousness, speaking in a seamless, eerie harmony by completing each other’s sentences. Their voices blend, creating a rhythmic cadence that conveys Tharagon’s thoughts with an air of mystery and power.

The man, representing Tharagon’s stormy nature, has storm-blue hair streaked with silver, piercing thundercloud eyes, and an air of command. Dressed in a dark blue velvet robe with subtle silver lightning motifs, he stands tall and stoic, reflecting Tharagon's sharp intellect and fierce resolve.

The woman embodies Tharagon’s fiery aspect, her flame-red hair flowing like embers, with intense, molten eyes that smolder with energy. Her crimson gown shimmers with flame patterns and gold accents, showcasing her bold, powerful presence, representing Tharagon’s passionate and aggressive spirit.

The child, symbolizing Tharagon’s connection to nature, has green hair adorned with tiny leaves, and deep, earthy eyes that seem wise beyond his years. Clad in a forest-green tunic with natural designs, he exudes an innocent yet enigmatic aura, capturing Tharagon's affinity with the wild, untamed earth.

The three figures move and speak in perfect synchronization, each holding a unique symbol of their elemental power—a scepter, a flame, and a sprig of leaves—making this form a manifestation of Tharagon’s layered personality and dominion.
