Xul'koroth, the Aboleth Mastermind

The sources unveil the identity and the true name of the enigmatic Patron orchestrating events across the realms: Xul'koroth, an ancient and powerful Aboleth.

●

The sources describe the Patron as a manipulative entity operating from the shadows, controlling individuals and factions to gather Netherese Globes

. This aligns with the Aboleths' nature as cunning masterminds who exert their influence through subtle psychic manipulation and prefer to control others rather than engage directly

.

●

The sources confirm that Zarov, a powerful vampire lord, serves the Patron, bound by the Dreamheart, an artefact that controls minds by holding a piece of their hearts

. This control over powerful figures aligns with the Aboleth's penchant for manipulating individuals to achieve their goals.

●

Notably, source

explicitly names Xul'koroth as the Aboleth seeking to gather the seven Netherese Globes.

●

Xul'koroth aims to activate the Celestial Stairway within the Tear of Selûne, a path to godhood, and re-establish the Aboleth's dominion over all planes of existence

. This goal reflects the Aboleth's ambition for power and their desire to reclaim their ancient dominance over the world.

Therefore, based on the information within the sources, the Patron is Xul'koroth, an ancient Aboleth pursuing a grand scheme to achieve godhood and restore the Aboleth's reign over the multiverse.
