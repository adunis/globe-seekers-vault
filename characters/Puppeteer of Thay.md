The Puppeteer of Thay is a ruthless necromancer known for his forbidden experiments and the creation of undead creatures. Among his most terrifying creations is Vordekai, a powerful necromancer whom he transformed into a Darakhul through experiments designed to push the boundaries of intelligent undeath.

Operating from the shadows, the Puppeteer has poisoned the water supply of the dwarven city of Khaldarin, contaminating it with necromantic essences to turn its inhabitants into undead servants. Simultaneously, he is planning to expand his influence over Amn, where he aims to raise an undead army to unleash upon the nations of Faer√ªn. With a calculating mind and an insatiable thirst for power, the Puppeteer is silently laying the groundwork for a reign of terror, poised to strike when the time is right.
