Rajah the Magnanimous is a renowned treasure hunter, known for his generosity towards less-established adventurers. He captains the Royal Sultan, a Halruuan flying ship modified for underwater travel.

Rajah appears during the party's exploration of the Isle of Kora-Kora, where they seek the Temple of Umberlee.

 While Temura and B.B. are able to conceal themselves from Rajah's ship, Morun Tag is caught in the Royal Sultan's spotlight.

The sources do not provide further information about Rajah's involvement in the events on Kora-Kora, nor do they explain whether his encounter with the party has any bearing on their subsequent interactions with Zathar or the Sahuagin.

While Rajah's appearance in the narrative is brief, his presence highlights a few key aspects of the campaign:

●

The allure of treasure hunting: Rajah's reputation as a treasure hunter emphasizes the significance of seeking valuable artefacts and riches within the campaign setting. His presence on Kora-Kora suggests the island may hold treasures beyond the Temple of Umberlee, attracting individuals like Rajah who are drawn to such pursuits.

●

The diversity of factions and individuals: The Royal Sultan's unique design, blending Halruuan technology with underwater capabilities, showcases the diversity of cultures and innovations within the campaign world. Rajah's presence further underscores this diversity, suggesting a world populated by individuals with unique skills, backgrounds, and motivations.

●

The potential for alliances and rivalries: Rajah's reputation for sharing wealth with less-known adventurers suggests a potential for alliances and cooperation within the treasure-hunting community. However, the competition for valuable artefacts could also lead to rivalries and conflicts between individuals seeking to acquire such treasures for themselves.

Although Rajah's role in the narrative remains somewhat unclear, his appearance hints at the broader context of the campaign, suggesting a world filled with adventurers, treasure hunters, and powerful individuals vying for control and influence.
