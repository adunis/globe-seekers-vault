### Spirits: Guardians of Primordial Magic

Spirits are the
unclaimed building blocks of life, existing in a state of pure energy
and potential. They are neither bound to mortal forms nor beholden to
the will of the gods or Primordial Lords. Instead, they roam the cosmos
freely, driven by their own desires, aspirations, and whims. Some
Spirits delight in aiding mortals to achieve grand ambitions, finding
joy in the creation of legacies. Others harbor grudges against certain
actions or philosophies, turning their power against those they oppose.

To
access Primordial Magic, mortals must form a bond with a Spirit,
offering their body as a conduit for the Spirit's presence in the Prime
Planes. This bond is not one of dominance but of partnership, often
requiring negotiation, mutual respect, or even cunning to secure a
Spiritâ€™s favor.

Outside these bonds, Spirits have little capacity
to directly influence the Prime Planes, though rare exceptions exist,
such as moments of cosmic alignment or areas saturated with primordial
energy.
