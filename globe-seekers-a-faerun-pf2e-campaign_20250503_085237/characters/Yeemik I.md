Yeemik is an Orc Shaman who appears in the final session of the “Black Spider Campaign.” After the defeat of the Black Spider, he appears alongside the elf Nininfrindel, announcing that they will hunt down the remaining members of the Cult of the Withered Thumb. Yeemik and Nininfrindel appear to be more than allies in this endeavour, as Bungo Dudo speculates they may be romantically involved.
