Materia, the Plane of Earth and Darkness, is a sprawling galaxy of countless celestial bodies suspended in the vast void. Unlike many other planes, it is not a single unified mass but a collection of immense flying rocks—worlds unto themselves—orbiting around larger, more massive stones that serve as their gravitational centers. These colossal anchors, glowing faintly with the energy of primal earth, are Materia's stars, each radiating subtle heat and light that sustain the countless smaller rocks swirling in their influence.

The great expanse of Materia stretches endlessly, its darkness punctuated by these luminous earth-stars and the shimmering veins of energy that connect them, visible like threads of a cosmic web. Around the largest rocks orbit smaller clusters: entire systems of floating islands, jagged shards of stone, and verdant biospheres suspended in the void. Each of these systems is a world unto itself, some teeming with life and civilizations, while others are barren wastes shaped by violent cataclysms or long-forgotten wars.

To the inhabitants of Materia, these "flying stones" represent both opportunity and peril. Some stones are habitable, their surfaces covered in forests of towering crystal trees or rivers of molten earth that glow like fire in the darkness. Others are desolate and jagged, swirling dangerously close to the void currents that sweep through the galaxy like unseen tides. These currents, infused with shadow energy, link the systems together and allow for travel, though only the bravest—or most foolish—dare to navigate their unpredictable paths.

Materia’s inhabitants view their galaxy as a place of infinite wonder and danger. The massive central rocks, resembling glowing stars, are believed to be living entities or ancient gods embodying the essence of earth. The smaller stones are their "offspring," scattered across the void to create endless opportunities for exploration and settlement. Entire civilizations have risen and fallen upon these stones, their ruins still visible as drifting monuments to lost ages.

In this grand cosmology, the galaxy of Materia is a realm of both primal earth and infinite shadow, where the interplay of gravity, energy, and darkness creates a dynamic and ever-changing world. It is not merely a metaphorical representation of a galaxy but a tangible, physical realm where the wonders of cosmic creation are as real as the stones beneath one's feet.

Materia, the Material Plane, a crucible for adaptation and evolution

, was not always the diverse tapestry of life we know today. Once, it was dominated by a powerful and influential civilisation known as the Terran Accord. This civilisation was a unique alliance of three distinct yet interconnected species: the saurian lizardfolk and the burrowing frog people. Together, they formed a powerful force that shaped the landscape and culture of Materia for millennia.

The saurian lizardfolk, with their tough scales, sharp claws, and affinity for the sun-baked deserts and rocky mountains, were the architects and warriors of the Terran Accord

. They built grand cities of sandstone and obsidian, their ziggurats reaching for the heavens, and they defended their territories with a ferocity that inspired awe and fear.

The burrowing frog people, with their smooth skin, webbed feet, and love of subterranean life, were the miners, artisans, and shamans of the Accord

. They delved deep into the earth, extracting precious metals and gems, crafting intricate jewellery and powerful talismans, and communing with the spirits of the earth to guide their people.

Bound by a common need for survival and prosperity, these three disparate species formed a symbiotic relationship, their strengths complementing each other. The saurians provided protection and structure, the frog people supplied resources and spiritual guidance, and the beastfolk ensured sustenance and exploration.

The Rise of the Terran Accord

The Terran Accord’s origins can be traced back to a time when Materia was a chaotic and fragmented realm, with various species vying for dominance. The saurians, frog people, and beastfolk, though possessing unique strengths, were individually vulnerable to larger predators and the harsh environments of the early Material Plane.

The catalyst for their union was a cataclysmic event – a massive asteroid impact that plunged Materia into darkness and triggered widespread environmental devastation. This event, known as the Great Sundering, forced the three species to band together for survival. The saurians, with their knowledge of architecture and warfare, constructed shelters and defended against predators. The frog people, using their burrowing skills, located underground springs and created safe havens. The beastfolk, relying on their keen senses, hunted for food and scouted for danger.

This shared struggle forged a bond of unity and interdependence between the three species, leading to the formation of the Terran Accord. They pooled their knowledge, skills, and resources, creating a synergistic society that thrived in the post-apocalyptic world.

The Terran Accord’s dominion over Materia lasted for centuries, a golden age of peace and prosperity. They established sprawling cities, cultivated vast farmlands, and developed intricate trade networks. They constructed magnificent temples dedicated to the deities of earth, darkness, and animals

, reflecting their deep connection to the natural world. Their shamans mastered the art of primal magic, drawing upon the power of nature to heal, to protect, and to guide their people.

The Decline and Departure

Despite their success, the seeds of the Terran Accord’s decline were sown within their very unity. The saurians, with their martial prowess, gradually assumed a dominant role, their focus shifting from cooperation to control. They began to view the frog people and beastfolk as subservient, imposing their will upon them and exploiting their resources.

This shift in power dynamics sparked resentment and rebellion, fracturing the once harmonious Accord. The frog people, disillusioned by the saurians’ arrogance, retreated deeper into their subterranean realms, isolating themselves from the surface world. The beastfolk, chafing under the saurians’ restrictions, migrated to the furthest reaches of Materia, seeking freedom in the untamed wilderness.

The saurians, now alone, found themselves vulnerable to a new threat – a plague that swept through their cities, decimating their population. Whether this plague was a natural occurrence or a consequence of their hubris, its impact was catastrophic. Their once-grand cities fell into ruin, their temples abandoned, their legacy fading into myth and legend.

With the Terran Accord’s collapse, Materia entered a new era, one characterized by diversity and adaptation. The departure of the saurians and frog people created a vacuum that was quickly filled by other species – humans, elves, dwarves, and countless others.

Echoes of the Past

Though the Terran Accord is long gone, its legacy endures, shaping the present-day Material Plane in subtle but profound ways. The remnants of their cities, now overgrown with vegetation or buried beneath the sands of time, serve as a testament to their architectural prowess. The ancient tunnels and mines dug by the frog people continue to be used, their intricate networks revealing glimpses of a forgotten civilisation. The hunting grounds and migratory paths of the beastfolk still influence the movements of animals, their presence felt in the rustling of leaves and the thunder of hooves.

The Terran Accord’s most lasting impact, however, is on Materia’s diverse ecology and cultural landscape. Their mastery of primal magic enriched the plane’s life force, creating fertile lands and fostering the evolution of countless species. Their reverence for nature instilled a deep respect for the natural world, inspiring future civilisations to seek harmony with their environment.

Materia’s history is a tapestry woven with threads of unity, conflict, and adaptation. The Terran Accord, though long gone, continues to shape the world, its echoes resonating through time, its legacy inspiring awe and wonder in those who seek to uncover its secrets.  
  

### Materia, the Material Plane (Mundus Prime)

**The Curse of Voracity**  
Materia is a place of unparalleled diversity and adaptation, but this bounty comes at a profound cost. Every creature born of this plane is bound by an ancient affliction known as the **Curse of Voracity**. This curse, tied to the very essence of Materia, compels all living beings to consume other life forms—plants, animals, or even each other—to survive. The curse is not simply a dietary requirement; it is an existential need, one that weaves itself into the cycle of life and death, perpetuating the harsh realities of survival. Those who refuse or fail to feed eventually wither, consumed by an insatiable hunger that leads to madness and death.

**The Spread of the Curse**  
The Curse of Voracity does not discriminate between native and foreign life. Creatures from other planes that come into prolonged contact with Materia are not spared. Over generations, their descendants inevitably succumb to the curse, their existence shaped by the same brutal laws. Even the most disciplined beings find themselves compelled to consume life, no matter how unnatural or abhorrent the act may seem to them.

This slow but inevitable transformation reshapes those who linger in Materia for too long, leaving them altered both physically and spiritually. Over time, their cultures adapt to include the necessity of predation, their societies developing rituals and justifications for the relentless cycle of consumption.

---

**Materia’s Unique Ecosystem**  
Materia’s ecology is a reflection of this harsh reality. Predation is not only a survival mechanism but a defining aspect of every living being’s existence. From the towering crystal trees whose roots siphon life from the soil to the apex predators that dominate the wilderness, every form of life contributes to a complex, brutal balance.

**The Curse’s Origins**  
Legends tell of the Curse of Voracity being tied to the fall of the Terran Accord. Some say the curse was the result of the saurian lizardfolk's hubris, a punishment for their domination over the other species. Others claim it was an ancient deal struck with the primal forces of earth and darkness, ensuring survival at a terrible price. Regardless of its origin, the curse has persisted, binding all life to its inexorable cycle.

---

### **The Terran Accord and the Curse**

The Terran Accord thrived despite the Curse of Voracity, its society rooted in cooperation and unity. Each species within the Accord adapted to the curse in its own way:

* **Saurian lizardfolk** embraced their role as apex predators, hunting with precision and reverence for the life they took.
* **Burrowing frog people** balanced their consumption with rituals of gratitude, channeling the life force of their prey into powerful talismans.
* **Beastfolk** became nomadic, following the migration patterns of their prey and ensuring no ecosystem was overexploited.

However, the Curse of Voracity also sowed the seeds of the Accord’s downfall. As resources grew scarce and the lizardfolk sought greater control, the fragile balance shattered. The rebellion of the frog people and the exodus of the beastfolk left the lizardfolk isolated, their society collapsing under the weight of their hubris and the curse's unyielding demands.

---

### **Echoes of Voracity**

The remnants of the Terran Accord stand as stark reminders of Materia’s harsh realities. Abandoned ziggurats and underground sanctuaries tell the story of a civilization that fought against the curse but was ultimately undone by it.

For those who seek to survive in Materia, understanding the Curse of Voracity is paramount. Whether adapting through symbiotic relationships, mastering primal magic to sustain life, or embracing the predator-prey dynamic, all life forms must bow to this unrelenting force.

The Curse of Voracity ensures that Materia remains both a place of unparalleled beauty and untold peril, its legacy written in the blood and bones of its inhabitants.

### he Influence of the Curse of Voracity on Non-Native Species

When the ancestors of elves, dwarves, gnomes, and other species from distant planes first arrived in Materia, they were not bound by the **Curse of Voracity**. Their origins in other planes, untouched by the primal forces of Materia, allowed them to exist without the need to consume other living beings for sustenance. However, the Curse of Voracity, deeply rooted in the essence of Materia, is not simply a local phenomenon—it is a pervasive, insidious force that alters life itself over time.

---

#### **The Gradual Transformation**

The ancestors of non-native species initially retained their planar independence. Their biology, shaped by the unique conditions of their home planes, did not immediately adapt to Materia's harsh rules. For generations, they lived off sunlight, magic, or even minimal sustenance, untouched by the curse.

However, Materia’s influence is persistent and unavoidable. Over time, as these species continued to live and reproduce within the plane, the Curse of Voracity began to take hold, subtly altering their descendants at the genetic and spiritual levels. This transformation occurred gradually:

1. **Physical Adaptation**  
   The plane’s energies infused their bodies, reshaping them to fit Materia’s laws. These changes often appeared as enhanced physical traits such as sharper senses, greater resilience, or new dietary needs.
2. **Spiritual Tethering**  
   The Curse of Voracity is as much a spiritual force as a physical one. Descendants of non-native species became spiritually entwined with Materia’s cycle of life and death, requiring them to consume other living beings to sustain their existence.
3. **Cultural Shifts**  
   As their descendants adapted biologically, their cultures began to reflect the curse’s influence. Rituals surrounding hunting, farming, and sustenance emerged, embedding the necessity of consumption into their way of life.

---

#### **The Birth of New Species**

This gradual transformation gave rise to the species we now recognize as elves, dwarves, gnomes, and others. While they retain many of the traits and traditions of their ancestors, their need to consume other living beings—plants, animals, or both—marks a fundamental departure from their original nature. Each species adapted in unique ways based on their ancestral traits and environmental conditions:

* **Elves**: Their longevity and deep connection to nature allowed them to develop harmonious ways to consume life, often revering the plants and animals they relied upon for survival.
* **Dwarves**: Their industriousness and resilience led them to focus on cultivating and harvesting life sustainably, often through careful management of underground ecosystems.
* **Gnomes**: Their creativity and curiosity drove them to experiment with ways to reduce their reliance on predation, leading to the development of innovative farming techniques and alchemical solutions.

---

#### **The Curse’s Dual Nature**

The Curse of Voracity acts as both a survival mechanism and a force of transformation. For the descendants of the original planar immigrants, it represents a new way of life dictated by Materia’s laws. While the curse compels them to consume life, it also binds them more deeply to the plane, granting them a unique understanding of its natural cycles and fostering a deep connection to its ecosystems.

---

#### **Legacy of the Ancestors**

The transformation from otherworldly ancestors to Materia’s new species highlights the plane’s power to reshape life in its image. The existence of elves, dwarves, and gnomes serves as a testament to Materia’s ability to adapt and integrate foreign elements into its ecosystem. While these species have lost some of their ancestral independence, they have gained a profound connection to their new home, becoming an inseparable part of Materia’s ever-evolving tapestry.
