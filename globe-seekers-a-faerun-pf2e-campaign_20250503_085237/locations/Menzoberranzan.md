Menzoberranzan is only mentioned briefly in the sources you have provided, but its significance lies in its relationship with Sshamath, another Drow city featured prominently in your campaign.

The sources highlight that exile from Sshamath is a fate worse than death for many Drow, particularly for those who fear capture by the priestesses of Menzoberranzan

. This fear suggests that Menzoberranzan represents a significant threat to the inhabitants of Sshamath, particularly those who have broken the city's laws. It also implies that Menzoberranzan and Sshamath are rival cities with a history of conflict.

It is also worth noting that the Black Spider, a major antagonist in your campaign, is a rogue Drow wizard from Menzoberranzan

. His presence in Sshamath and his involvement in the city's power struggles may indicate that the rivalry between the two cities extends beyond mere political disputes.
