## The Ultimate Goal of Deity Worship

## 

The primary objective for deities in this cosmology is to accumulate powerful souls, which are transformed into Divine Beings upon the mortal's death. This goal supersedes the mere accumulation of power points from offerings, as those are temporary and expendable. The reasons for this focus include:

1. Defense and Survival:
   * The Divine World (Outer Planes) is a realm of constant competition and potential conflict between deities.
   * Powerful Divine Beings serve as a deity's army, defenders, and agents.
   * A deity with numerous high-level Divine Beings is better equipped to defend their Divine Plane against incursions from rival deities.
2. Expansion and Influence:
   * Divine Beings can travel between Divine Planes, allowing deities to project their influence beyond their own realm.
   * More powerful Divine Beings can undertake more significant missions, potentially swaying the balance of power in the Divine World.
3. Cosmic Relevance:
   * The number and power of a deity's Divine Beings directly correlate to their standing in the divine hierarchy.
   * Deities with few or weak Divine Beings risk becoming irrelevant or being absorbed by more powerful deities.
4. Sustainable Power:
   * While power points from offerings are useful for immediate actions, Divine Beings represent a long-term, sustainable source of power.
   * Even if a deity's worship wanes in the mortal realm, their existing Divine Beings remain as a power base.
5. Divine Economy:
   * Powerful souls are a finite resource, leading to competition among deities for the devotion of exceptional mortals.
   * This competition drives divine intervention in the mortal world, as deities seek to cultivate and protect their most devoted followers.
6. Cosmic Balance:
   * The distribution of powerful souls among deities helps maintain a cosmic balance.
   * If one deity becomes too powerful, others might form alliances to check their growth.
