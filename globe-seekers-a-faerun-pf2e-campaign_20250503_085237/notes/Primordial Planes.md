The Primordial Planes and the Intrusion of Gods

The Primordial Planes are the most fundamental layer of reality. Existing before the concept of 'creation' they are realms of pure, unadulterated elemental essence

. Each plane embodies a core aspect of existence: Fire, Earth, Air, Water, Ice, Magma, Lightning, Metal, Light, Darkness, Life, and Death

.

The [note:6927631]s rule these planes. They are not gods in the conventional sense - they do not require worship or belief to sustain their power. Instead, they are embodiments of the planes themselves, their very beings inseparable from the elemental forces they command.

Imagine these Lords not as beings of flesh and blood, but as colossal, ever-shifting manifestations of their respective elements. The Primordial Lord of Fire might be a raging inferno, constantly expanding and consuming, while the Lord of Earth could be a vast, mountainous being, unyielding and ancient.

Knowing they couldn't manifest physically outside their realms, the Primordials created the Prime Planes as a buffer, shielding the raw power of the Primordial Planes from extra-dimensional threats

. These Prime Planes, infused with diluted elemental energies, birthed diverse forms of life, each carrying a spark of the Primordial Planes' power - a soul. Each soul is locked in a cycle of reincarnation, its energy returning to the Primordial Planes upon death, maintaining a delicate cosmic equilibrium

.

To govern and safeguard these Prime Planes, the Primordials created the Djinns. Powerful elemental beings, Djinns act as extensions of the Primordial Lords' will, each type attuned to a specific Prime Plane

. These Djinns commanded vast armies of elementals, enforcing the Primordials' dominion.

However, the Primordials could not have foreseen the arrival of the gods. These beings, not from this reality, came seeking a source of energy to fuel their waning existence

. The Prime Planes, teeming with mortal life and the energy of their souls, provided a solution. The gods, recognizing the potential of these mortal souls, established a system where worship diverted the flow of souls' energy toward themselves, granting them power and a form of immortality

.

The arrival of the gods was an unforeseen intrusion. The Primordials, bound to their planes, could only watch as the gods established themselves on the Prime Planes, their influence spreading. They lost control, their carefully crafted balance disrupted.

A Universe in Conflict: The Primordials' Wrath

The presence of gods, siphoning the energy that naturally flowed back to the Primordial Planes, is anathema to the Primordials. It represents an existential threat, a slow drain on their very essence.

This is why the Primordials now seek to eradicate all life from the Prime Planes

. Their goal is not one of malice, but of necessity. By returning the Prime Planes to their original, barren state, they can re-establish the natural flow of energy back to the Primordial Planes.

They orchestrate this eradication through the Djinns. These once-noble guardians now act as instruments of destruction, unleashing cataclysmic disasters upon the Prime Planes. Floods, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and storms of unimaginable ferocity ravage the Prime Planes, reshaping landscapes and extinguishing the flame of life.

Imagine the Prime Plane of Pyronis, once a realm of fire and creation, now ravaged by volcanic eruptions of unprecedented scale, molten rivers consuming everything in their path. Or the Prime Plane of Thalassa, its once-thriving oceans now churning with monstrous tsunamis and storms, wiping out entire civilizations.

The Primordials are playing a long game, one that spans millennia. They understand that time flows differently for them. A thousand years on the Prime Planes is but a fleeting moment in the endless existence of a Primordial Lord.

The cosmos is now a battleground, a struggle between the gods, desperately clinging to their stolen power, and the Primordials, seeking to restore the balance they meticulously crafted eons ago. And caught in the middle are the mortals of the Prime Planes, pawns in a cosmic game they don't even comprehend.
