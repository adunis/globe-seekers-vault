**Cleric Outfit**: Sharâ€™s clerics wear obsidian-black robes with faint, star-like patterns, resembling a void of endless night. Their robes have hoods that cover most of their faces, leaving only their eyes visible. They carry disk-shaped chakrams with sharp edges, and their attire is sleek and form-fitting, allowing them to move silently through the shadows.
