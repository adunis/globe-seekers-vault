The Feywild, born from the Plane of Life and the Plane of Light, is a realm of vibrant chaos and ephemeral beauty. Its native language, Sylvan, reflects this nature.

●

Language of Emotion and Belief: Sylvan is fluid and ever-changing, its meaning shaped by the speaker's emotions and the listener's beliefs. A single word can convey a multitude of meanings, shifting like the light filtering through a forest canopy.

●

Whispers of Nature: Imagine Sylvan as a language of rustling leaves, babbling brooks, and birdsong, each sound carrying a whisper of magic and a hint of mischief. Those who speak Sylvan fluently can weave enchantments with their words, charm the very trees into dancing, or conjure illusions that blur the line between reality and dreams.
