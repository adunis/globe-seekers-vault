Cormyr is a feudalistic kingdom governed by a council of archangels, each representing a god—Lathander, Anhur, Tyr, Ilmater, and Bahamut. While this divine council oversees major decisions from the background, they appoint a King to act as their earthly ruler and uphold their vision for Cormyr. Known for its powerful military, Cormyr is protected by elite gryphon riders and mighty clerics, whose divine power fortifies the realm’s defenses.

The kingdom’s history is deeply intertwined with that of an ancient elven empire whose ruins are now part of Cormyr's cities, giving rise to a mixed population where half-elves live alongside humans. This elven heritage contributes to Cormyr’s cultural richness and unique architectural charm, blending ancient magic with human resilience.

**Opposition to the Kraken King:** Cormyr is actively involved in resisting the Kraken King's expanding influence across the Sea of Fallen Stars. The kingdom’s Imperial Navy patrols the Dragonmere and the surrounding waters, guarding against this threat. Recently, Cormyr’s King, under the guidance of the archangels, condemned the Kraken King’s actions, pledging to safeguard Cormyr’s interests in the region.

**Military Legacy and Presence on Kora-Kora:** The Isle of Kora-Kora, once home to a Cormyrean weapons research outpost, reflects the kingdom’s long-standing commitment to military innovation and readiness. Cormyr invests in research and development to remain prepared for conflicts, ensuring its forces are equipped to defend against external threats.

**Nobility and Valor:** Cormyr’s culture emphasizes nobility, valor, and a strong sense of patriotism, inspired by the virtues upheld by the archangels. Citizens honor their military past by donning attire that depicts animated historical battles, embodying the pride and heroism that define Cormyr's values.

**Political Challenges and Regional Conflicts:** In the broader region, Akanul, ruled by the Elemental Lords, is currently at war with the Wyrmclaws, a dragon faction. This escalating conflict poses potential threats to the balance of power in the Sea of Fallen Stars, and Cormyr may soon need to decide whether to intervene or support one side to preserve stability.

Overall, Cormyr is a strong and influential kingdom where divine guidance shapes its policies and inspires its people. The kingdom’s military prowess, rich heritage, and commitment to protecting its lands exemplify its role as a formidable and respected presence in the region.
