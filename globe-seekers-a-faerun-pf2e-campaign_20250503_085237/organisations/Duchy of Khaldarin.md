Khaldarin is a hidden city located in the Galena Mountains.

●

It is renowned for its exceptional metallurgy.

The sources offer limited information about the city's culture or society, but they suggest that Khaldarin has faced significant challenges:

●

Khaldarin has been corrupted by the influence of the Kingdom of Damara and a mysterious entity known as the Patron.

●

Damara has forced Khaldarin to produce weapons and armour, seemingly in preparation for a large-scale conflict.

●

Thorgrim "Er Tozzo" Fireforge's brother, Daren, collaborated with these forces, betraying his people and contributing to Khaldarin's subjugation.

Er Tozzo, a dwarven fighter and former member of the Silver Blades mercenary company, is now in exile.

 His ultimate goal is to liberate Khaldarin from Damara's control and confront Daren.

The sources do not offer any information about:

●

The specific location of Khaldarin within the Galena Mountains.

●

The history of Khaldarin before its subjugation by Damara.

●

The nature of the Patron's influence on Khaldarin.

●

The current state of Khaldarin under Damara's rule.

Khaldarin, though shrouded in mystery, represents a significant element in Er Tozzo's personal narrative. Uncovering more information about Khaldarin, its people, and its fate could reveal crucial insights into the broader conflicts within the world and the motivations of those involved.
