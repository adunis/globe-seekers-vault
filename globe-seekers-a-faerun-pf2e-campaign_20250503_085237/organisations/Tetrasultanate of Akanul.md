Exploring Akanul: A Genasi Nation Above the Sea of Fallen Stars

Akanul is a nation of Genasi situated above the Sea of Fallen Stars. The sources highlight Akanul's significance in the campaign setting through its resources, political conflicts, and the presence of a powerful artifact, the Urna of Geb.

●

Genasi Heritage and Elemental Mastery: The Genasi, the inhabitants of Akanul, are a race of humanoids with elemental ancestry. Known for their profound connection to the elemental planes and mastery of elemental magic, they play a pivotal role in the events unfolding in the campaign.

●

Airspur: A City Above the Sea: Airspur serves as the floating capital of Akanul. Renowned for its production of crystals, magic gems, and weapons infused with elemental power, the city holds economic and strategic value within the Sea of Fallen Stars region.

 Airspur also features an arena that hosts a tournament for monster trainers, demonstrating the significance of these creatures in Akanul's culture and potentially offering opportunities for interaction and competition within the narrative.

●

Ruling Structure: The Four Lords Elemental: Akanul is governed by the Four Lords Elemental:

○

Lord Arin the Unconquerable (Earth)

○

Lady Lirien the Wild (Air)

○

Lord Thoren the Inexorable (Fire)

○

Lady Niamh the Deep (Water)

○

These powerful figures likely hold considerable influence within Akanul, shaping its policies and potentially serving as allies or adversaries depending on the party's actions.

●

Conflict with the Wyrmclaws: Akanul finds itself embroiled in a war with the Wyrmclaws, a formidable dragon empire aiming to seize control of the nation's valuable resources.

 This conflict has significantly impacted Akanul's economy and stability. Notably, the Wyrmclaws have established alliances with certain party members, including Korgak.

This complex relationship could lead to difficult choices for the party, forcing them to navigate the intricacies of these alliances while pursuing their own goals.

●

Political Intrigue and External Influences: The war between Akanul and the Wyrmclaws has drawn the attention of other nations in the region.

○

Tymanther and Turmish: These nations have provided aid to Akanul, viewing the Wyrmclaws as a threat to regional stability.

○

Chessenta and Unther: These nations, seeking to exploit the conflict for their own gain, have secretly supported the Wyrmclaws.

○

This web of alliances and rivalries creates a dynamic political landscape that the party must navigate as they interact with Akanul.

●

The Urna of Geb: A Netherese Globe: The Urna of Geb, initially believed to be a simple artifact, is revealed to be a Netherese Globe, one of several powerful artifacts scattered throughout the realms.

 These Globes are key to unlocking divine power and play a central role in the overarching narrative. The Urna of Geb was previously in Akanul's possession, likely used to rebuild their nation.

Its significance makes Akanul a focal point for various factions seeking to control this powerful artifact.

Akanul's Significance

Akanul is not merely a location on a map; it is a dynamic nation with a rich history, complex political relationships, and a central role in the campaign's unfolding events. The party's interactions with Akanul, its leaders, and its conflicts will likely have significant consequences, shaping their journey and influencing the fate of the region.  
  
Akanul is a nation of Genasi ruled by the four Lords Elemental: Lord Arin the Unconquerable (Earth), Lady Lirien the Wild (Air), Lord Thoren the Inexorable (Fire), and Lady Niamh the Deep (Water). Akanul is known for producing crystals, magic gems and weapons infused with elemental power.

The sources do not specify where Akanul is located, but they do mention that it is a coastal nation.

 Akanul's capital is the floating city of Airspur, which is located above the Sea of Fallen Stars.

Akanul is a relatively new nation that is struggling to rebuild after being devastated by wars.

 One of Akanul's enemies is the Wyrmclaws, a faction of dragons led by the blue dragon Tharagon the Unconquerable. The Wyrmclaws want to take control of Akanul's resources.

●

The war between Akanul and the Wyrmclaws has created profitable opportunities for merchant guilds, including the Merchant's Guild of Waterdeep and the Merchant's Guild of Amn.

 These guilds have been selling magic components, weapons and mercenaries to the Genasi. Other guilds, such as the Shipbuilders Guild and the Sailors Guild, have been negatively impacted by the war because of disrupted trade routes and scarce resources.

●

The nations of Tymanther and Turmish have supported Akanul's fight against the Wyrmclaws, while Chessenta and Unther have secretly supported the Wyrmclaws in hopes of gaining an advantage in the region.

One possible buyer for the rare personal ballistae is the nation of Akanul, represented by General Thora Stormhammer, a Genasi of the Air and former captain of flying ships.

 She believes the ballistae would be helpful against the Wyrmclaws.
