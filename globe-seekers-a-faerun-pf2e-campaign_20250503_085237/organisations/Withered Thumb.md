The Withered Thumb druids are a group of druids experimenting with dark magic in Cragmaw Castle. The party learns about this group from Nimrodel, a female druid, after they help her fight a group of orcs. The orcs had been attacking a treant and are described as being under the influence of some dark power. Nimrodel has been tracking the orcs, and her investigation suggests the Withered Thumb druids are responsible for the orcs' behaviour

One of the key documents discovered in Cragmaw Castle reveals details of the Withered Thumb's experiments, indicating that their goal is to control goblinoids using spore-based methods

This is further evidenced by the party's challenging encounter with a spore-infected owlbear in the castle. The owlbear's infection is a direct result of the druids' experiments and highlights the dangerous biological manipulations they are capable of

The sources you provided do not explicitly state the goals of the Withered Thumb, nor do they explain what the group hopes to achieve by controlling goblinoids. It is worth noting that this ambiguity might be intentional to allow you to further develop the Withered Thumb's story in your campaign.
