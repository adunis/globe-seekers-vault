* ### Plot of the "Globe Seekers" Campaign

  The "Globe Seekers"
  campaign follows the players on a quest to prevent the ascension of the
  Patron, a malevolent Aboleth, who seeks godhood. The Patron’s plan
  involves using the Netherese Globes—powerful artifacts that can
  manipulate magic—to execute a ritual that will kill a deity, thereby
  creating a power vacuum in the divine hierarchy. The Heavenly Staircase,
  the only site on the Material Plane where gods can manifest fully and
  mortals can ascend, is central to the Patron's scheme.

  ### Central Conflict
* **The Patron's Ambition**:
  Determined to become a god, the Patron’s goal to kill a deity and
  ascend using the Netherese Globes sets up a high-stakes confrontation.
* **Players’ Mission**:
  The players must navigate a world rife with danger, intrigue, and
  powerful entities vying for their own interests in the chaos.

---

### Key Locations

* **Airspur**:
  A city under dragon siege and surrounded by occult intrigue, holding a
  Netherese Globe, making it a focal point in the campaign.
* **The Heavenly Staircase**:
  This sacred site, protected by the Temple of Selune, is crucial to the
  Patron's plan, as it is the only place where his ascension ritual can
  take place.
* **Akanûl**: Ruled by elemental lords
  and at war with the Wyrmclaw, a dragon faction, Akanûl offers players
  opportunities to forge alliances and gather resources.

---

### Factions and Characters

* **The Kraken King**: A formidable pirate lord allied with the Patron, controlling key sea routes and possessing a Netherese Globe.
* **The Wyrmclaw**: A faction of dragons in conflict with Akanûl, which could become either allies or enemies, based on the players' choices.
* **Key NPCs**:
  Diverse figures such as Malaria, the Wererat Queen, and Nyssandra, a
  vengeful drow warrior, whose assistance or opposition may depend on
  player interactions.

---

### Possible Endings

* **Triumphant Victory**:
  The players thwart the Patron’s plans, saving a deity from destruction
  and emerging as celebrated heroes who could reshape Faerûn’s future.
* **Pyrrhic Victory**: Although the Patron is stopped, it comes at a high personal cost, with sacrifices that alter the world permanently.
* **Bittersweet Resolution**:
  The players delay the Patron’s ascension, but do not fully stop him,
  leaving an enduring threat that could spark future campaigns.
* **Crushing Defeat**: The Patron succeeds, ascends to godhood, and reshapes Faerûn to his will, plunging the world into chaos or tyranny.

---

### Additional Considerations

* **The Divine Economy**:
  The campaign examines the relationship between mortals and deities. The
  Patron’s ambition could disrupt this divine system, bringing unforeseen
  consequences for both the Material Plane and the celestial hierarchy.
* **The Netherese Globes**:
  Powerful and rare, the Netherese Globes represent both a resource and a
  moral quandary. Players may seek to collect them to counter the
  Patron’s power or use them for their own ends, introducing potential
  conflicts and dilemmas.

---

The plot and outcomes for the
"Globe Seekers" campaign will ultimately hinge on player choices and the
Dungeon Master's interpretation, making each journey unique in its
stakes and consequences.
