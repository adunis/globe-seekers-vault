Akanul's Airspur: A City Above the Sea

Airspur is the floating capital city of Akanul, a nation of [[Genasi]] located somewhere above the Sea of Fallen Stars

. The city is known for its production of crystals, magic gems, and weapons infused with elemental power

.

Airspur is also known for its arena where a tournament for monster trainers is held

.

The [[Genasi]] and their Nation

[[Genasi]] are a race of humanoids with elemental ancestry. They are known for their strong connection to the elemental planes and their mastery of elemental magic. Akanul is a relatively new nation, having been devastated by wars in the past. As a result, the [[Genasi]] are eager to rebuild their nation and reclaim their former glory

. The nation is ruled by the four Lords Elemental:

●

Lord Arin the Unconquerable (Earth)

●

Lady Lirien the Wild (Air)

●

Lord Thoren the Inexorable (Fire)

●

Lady Niamh the Deep (Water)

Akanul's Place in Faerûn

The sources don't specify exactly where Akanul is located, but it is mentioned that it is a coastal nation. The nation's location and its access to rare resources make it a valuable target for other nations and factions. The Wyrmclaws, a dragon empire, have been waging war against Akanul in an attempt to seize control of the nation's resources

.

Other nations, like Tymanther and Turmish, have provided aid to Akanul in its fight against the Wyrmclaws, while Chessenta and Unther have secretly supported the Wyrmclaws in hopes of gaining an advantage in the region

.

The Importance of Trade

Akanul's economy is heavily reliant on trade. The nation's production of crystals, magic gems, and elemental weapons is highly sought after by other nations. However, the war with the Wyrmclaws has disrupted Akanul's trade routes and made it difficult for the nation to maintain its economy

. As a result, various merchant guilds have stepped in to fill the void, including:

●

The Merchant's Guild of Waterdeep

●

The Merchant's Guild of Amn

These guilds have been profiting from the conflict by providing Akanul with goods and services, such as magic components, magic weapons, and mercenaries. However, other guilds, such as the Shipbuilders Guild and the Sailors Guild, have been negatively impacted by the war due to disrupted trade routes and scarce resources
