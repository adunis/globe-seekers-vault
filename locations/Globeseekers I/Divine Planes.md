Each
deity maintains a unique plane connected to all [[Prime Planes]] through
the Astral Sea, reflecting their nature and domains. In these divine
planes, only the servants and manifestations of the deities can be
found. Creatures such as dragons, dryads, elementals, and other beings
native to the [[Prime Planes]] do not inhabit these realms.
