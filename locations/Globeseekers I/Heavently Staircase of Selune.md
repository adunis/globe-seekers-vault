Heavently Staircase of Selune

The Heavently Staircase of Selune is a location of significant importance within the [[Cosmology]] of the Forgotten Realms, specifically within the world of Faerûn. It is described as the only place on the Material Plane where deities can manifest in their true forms, rather than through avatars. Additionally, it is the sole location where a mortal being can ascend to godhood.

Location and Access

The precise location of the Heavently Staircase is shrouded in secrecy. However, sources indicate that its position is recorded within the archives of the Temple of Selune, located in the capital city of an unnamed faction. This suggests a strong connection to the followers of Selune and the possibility that they play a role in protecting or controlling access to this sacred site.

Relationship to Deities

The Heavently Staircase possesses a unique relationship with the gods of Faerûn. It is said to be a point where the barriers between the Material Plane and the divine realms are weakened, allowing deities to manifest in their true forms without expending divine power. [Conversation History] This ability implies that the Heavently Staircase serves as a conduit for divine energies, facilitating interaction between mortals and the gods. [Conversation History]

Significance in the Divine Economy

The Heavently Staircase plays a crucial role in the "Divine Economy" of Faerûn, the system that governs the relationship between mortals and deities. As the only location where mortals can ascend to godhood, it represents the pinnacle of divine aspiration and the ultimate goal for those seeking to transcend their mortal limitations.

Role in Current Events

Current events in Faerûn highlight the strategic importance of the Heavently Staircase. A powerful Aboleth known as the Patron seeks to exploit the site's unique properties to achieve his own ascension to godhood. [2, Conversation History] The Patron intends to utilize one of the Netherese Globes, powerful artefacts capable of manipulating magical energies, to achieve this goal, suggesting a potential connection between these objects and the divine.

Furthermore, the Patron's plan to eliminate an existing deity and usurp their position within the pantheon could transform the Heavently Staircase into a focal point of conflict between divine forces. [Conversation History]
