Hene is an Aasimar Paladin who follows the god Tyr. Her central motivation throughout the campaign is to get revenge against the Red Sashes who she believes killed her brother.

Hene has a strong sense of justice, honour, and duty. She is quick to act, and decisive in battle. She sees the world in black and white terms, and has little patience for those who she perceives as weak or indecisive. This brings her into conflict with Grogo, the cleric of Ilmater, who preaches forgiveness and compassion, even for one’s enemies. She eventually learns that forgiveness is sometimes possible, although she still believes in punishing the guilty.

Hene’s player has opted for a “Giant” character design. This means that Yilvina can cast the Enlarge/Reduce spell on Hene, allowing her to grow to a huge size during combat.

Hene fights with a magical hammer called the Moonbane. This hammer was forged by the party in the Wave Echo Cave. It contains the soul of her brother, giving it special powers against lycanthropes.

Hene often makes sarcastic or witty remarks, especially to Bungo Dudo. She is not afraid to stand up for herself, and is always ready for a fight. Although she is sometimes impatient with Bungo Dudo’s scholarly explanations, she eventually recognises that he can be helpful.

Despite her tough exterior, Hene is deeply affected by the loss of her brother. She eventually accepts that he is gone, and learns to find peace without revenge. At the end of the campaign, Hene remains dedicated to her god Tyr, and continues to fight for justice in Baldur’s Gate.
