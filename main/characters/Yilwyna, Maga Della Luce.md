Yilvynna is a Drow woman who initially appears disguised as a Drow man seeking the Troll butcher. She is later revealed to be a powerful spellcaster seeking to eliminate the Black Spider.

●

The party encounters Yilvynna in this guise during Session 7-8 in Sshamath.

●

After a confrontation in Session 9, where the party defeats her, she reveals her true identity and proposes an alliance.

Yilvynna's Goals

Yilvynna's primary objective is to eliminate the Black Spider, a renegade Drow wizard from Menzoberranzan. She explains to the party that the Black Spider is aligned with the School of Necromancy in Sshamath, which is engaged in a power struggle with the School of Conjuration.

Yilvynna's Expertise

Yilvynna is a skilled magic user. The sources indicate that:

●

She possesses a City Guide, indicating her knowledge of Sshamath.

●

She teaches the party the cantrip Aura Sight and plans to teach them Aura Shroud, a skill crucial for concealing their presence from others who can detect auras.

Yilvynna's Fate

Yilvynna is presumably captured or killed by the Black Spider during the events of Session 10, when she is struck by a stone giant's attack.

Unanswered Questions

While the sources provide some information about Yilvynna, they leave several questions unanswered:

●

Motivations: What are Yilvynna's specific reasons for wanting to eliminate the Black Spider? Is it purely a matter of political rivalry between the schools of magic, or are there personal reasons driving her vendetta?

●

Background: What is Yilvynna's history? Where does she come from, and how did she acquire her skills and knowledge?

●

Return: Does Yilvynna actually die in Session 10? The sources are unclear about her fate, leaving open the possibility of her return later in the campaign.

These unanswered questions provide opportunities to expand upon Yilvynna's character and role in the narrative. You can use these gaps in the information to create a more complex and intriguing backstory, motivations, and potential future involvement in the campaign.
