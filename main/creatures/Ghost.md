### Ghosts: Anomalies of Divine Creation

In stark contrast to Spirits, **Ghosts**
are anomalies born from divine intervention gone awry. These are souls
intended to return to their origin in the Primordial Planes or
transition to the divine realms, but something interrupts their journey.
Whether due to the meddling of gods, mortal interference, or the
shattering of natural laws, these displaced souls become trapped in
limbo, severed from the natural cycle of reincarnation.

Unlike
Spirits, Ghosts are not free agents of primordial chaos. They are
fractured echoes of once-living beings, tethered to the Prime Planes by
unresolved emotions, unfulfilled purposes, or external manipulation.
While some may find peace and eventually move on, others grow restless
or vengeful, haunting the mortal world as remnants of divine
imperfection.
