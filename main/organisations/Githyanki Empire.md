In the shattered world after the Great Descent, the Githyanki, once
ruthless raiders from across the planes, are now a fragmented force,
their ancient pact with the aboleth Xul'koroth strained. Xul'koroth,
whose ambitions shifted after the divine war, now seeks a deeper
understanding of this changed reality.

* **Azara's Choice:** Azara, a githzerai fleeing the ruins of her
  monastery after its collapse during the Great Descent, desperately sought
  any means to preserve her people's traditions. Drawn in by promises of
  knowledge, she delivered a Netherese Globe to the Githyanki hoping it
  would be studied, a decision that continues to haunt her.
* **Vordekai's Experiment:** Vordekai's morbid fascination led him to
  offer githyanki brains and hearts to githzerai guards, a gesture meant
  to understand their resilience and resilience. The act, a grotesque
  attempt at diplomacy in a broken world, further deepened the divide
  between the two peoples.
* **Time and Unlife:** Haunted by visions of temporal anomalies after
  the Great Descent, Vordekai theorized about incorporating a time crystal
  into his phylactery. He envisioned using this artifact not to age
  githyanki, but to unravel the mysteries of the celestial staircase in an
  attempt to return it to its place in the heavens.
* **Cosmic Pawns:** Zorvath, a Netherese mage reborn into a world he
  barely recognizes after the Great Descent, revealed that the Githyanki,
  now scattered remnants seeking purpose, had been manipulated by
  Xul'koroth. He sought to use them to gather Netherese Globes, intending
  to study their chaotic energies to understand the impact of the divine
  war, not to ascend to godhood as Zorvath initially claimed.

Driven by the need to navigate a post-apocalyptic world, the Githyanki
are caught between a desperate search for purpose and the manipulations of
Xul'koroth. Their conflict with the Githzerai continues, a tragic echo of
a war that shattered the multiverse.

**Plot Hooks:**

* Rumors surface of a hidden Githyanki enclave possessing a map leading
  to a fragment of the Celestial Staircase, a relic said to hold the power
  to mend the shattered connection between the planes. The PCs are tasked
  with finding this map before Xul'koroth can claim it.
* A Githzerai refugee seeks asylum in a community the PCs are protecting,
  claiming to possess knowledge of Xul'koroth's plans. However, they are
  pursued by Githyanki assassins, forcing the PCs to choose between
  protecting the refugee and risking war with a powerful foe.
* The PCs discover evidence that Vordekai, driven mad by the instability of
  time after his failed temporal experiment, has allied with a faction of
  Githyanki seeking to rewrite history and undo the Great Descent,
  potentially unraveling the fabric of reality itself.
