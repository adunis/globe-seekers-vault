Amn is a mercantocracy ruled by ambitious merchants who have transformed it into a powerhouse of trade and wealth, ruthlessly exploiting other lands to fuel their ambitions. Its economy thrives on strategic manipulation, with Amn’s powerful Merchant’s Guild profiting from the ongoing conflicts between neighboring regions, including the war between Akanul and the Wyrmclaws, where they supply goods and services for profit. Amn maintains a formidable naval presence, protecting its lucrative trade routes and securing its interests across the Sea of Fallen Stars, where it faces growing threats from the Kraken King, a pirate warlord with dominion over sea creatures.

Beneath the polished façade of Amn's wealth, however, lies a darker truth. Vampires secretly control the nation, accepted by society as the most influential sponsors of the merchant elite. These undead patrons ensure their own prosperity and protect the merchant class, using their considerable power to manipulate Amn’s foreign and domestic policies from the shadows. In turn, these merchants remain fiercely loyal, using the military to assert Amn’s dominance over resource-rich territories and to protect the vampire sponsors’ interests. The Patron, a mysterious and powerful vampire figure, exerts influence beyond Amn’s borders, manipulating factions across the multiverse to further their unknown goals.

While internal conflicts and tensions simmer under the surface, with accusations of anti-government plots suggesting the existence of rebel factions, Amn’s government remains steadfast. Its mercantile class shows no hesitation in sacrificing loyalty or morals in exchange for wealth and influence, leveraging alliances and rivalries in equal measure to expand Amn's power in the face of both mortal and supernatural forces.
