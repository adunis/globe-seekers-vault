## Deity Lifecycle

# Birth of Deities

In the realm of Faerun,
deities are not eternal, unchanging entities. They can be born, grow in
power, and even die. The birth of a deity is a rare and momentous event,
often occurring through one of the following methods:

1. **Collective Belief**:
   When a significant number of mortals begin to make offerings to a
   concept or idea that isn't associated with an existing deity, a new
   minor deity may spontaneously form. This process, known as "Divine
   Coalescence," typically takes centuries of consistent offerings.
2. **Ascension**:
   Exceptionally powerful mortals, such as legendary heroes or mighty
   wizards, may ascend to godhood through great deeds or by accumulating
   vast amounts of magical energy. This process is called "Mortal
   Apotheosis."
3. **Divine Splitting**:
   In rare cases, an existing deity may split into two or more separate
   entities. This can happen when a deity's domains become too diverse or
   contradictory, or as a result of a major schism among their followers.
4. **Cosmic Events**:
   Unique celestial or planar events may sometimes result in the birth of
   new deities. These "Cosmic Births" are unpredictable and often result in
   deities with unusual or hybrid domains.

## Death of Deities

Just as deities can be born,
they can also die. The death of a deity is a cataclysmic event that can
have far-reaching consequences for the world. Deities can die through:

1. **Power Depletion**:
   If a deity's followers stop making offerings or if their domains become
   irrelevant, they may slowly fade away, a process known as "Divine
   Entropy."
2. **Divine Conflict**: Deities can be killed by other deities in direct conflict, though such battles are rare and devastating.
3. **Cosmic Calamity**: Certain world-altering events may result in the death of one or more deities.
4. **Voluntary Dissolution**:
   In extremely rare cases, a deity may choose to end their own existence,
   often to prevent a greater catastrophe or to empower their followers.

When a deity dies, their power may dissipate, be absorbed by other deities, or linger in the world as wild magic.

## Divine Delegation

## Divine Hierarchy

Major Deities have the
ability to delegate their acquired domain powers. This system, known as
"Divine Hierarchy," allows for more efficient management of mortal
requests and can extend a Major Deity's influence across broader
geographical or cultural areas.

### Minor Deities

Minor Deities often receive
delegated powers from Major Deities. They typically specialize in
specific aspects of a domain or cater to particular regions or cultures.
These Minor Deities act as intermediaries, handling localized divine
matters while Major Deities focus on larger-scale divine governance. There are 'Indipendent' Minor Deities but these are rare and few because most Minor Deities tend to affiliate with a Major to ensure their survival. A Minor Deity without a Major Deity backing it up runs the risk to be killed and assimilated very easily by another Major Deity that wants to claim its power.

### Priestly Powers

The Divine Hierarchy extends
to an even more granular level, with deities granting minuscule amounts
of their power to their priests. This delegation allows for a greater
reach of divine power and enables priests to fulfill minor requests
directly.

For example, a Priest of
Healing empowered by their deity could travel from village to village,
healing people who have made offerings to the God of Healing. This
system allows for more immediate and localized divine intervention,
strengthening the connection between mortals and their deities.

This granular delegation serves several purposes:

1. It extends the deity's reach and influence.
2. It allows for more efficient handling of minor requests.
3. It strengthens the religious hierarchy and the role of priests in society.
4. It provides tangible evidence of divine power to common people, reinforcing the Divine Economy system.

## The Divine Economy

## Power Acquisition

Unlike traditional religious
systems, Faerun deities do not gain power through worship alone.
Instead, their power is derived from offerings made by mortals. The most
common form of offering is time, typically given in the form of prayer.
More substantial offerings can include animal sacrifices or valuable
goods.

### Faith and Worship

In Faerun, faith as
understood in many real-world religions does not exist. Deities are
tangible, real entities whose existence is a matter of common knowledge.
As a result, individuals are not bound to a single deity and can make
offerings to multiple gods based on their current needs or desires.

### Offering and Request System

When making an offering,
mortals typically accompany it with a specific request. For example, a
farmer might sacrifice an animal to the deity of agriculture, requesting
a bountiful harvest, and later offer a prayer to the deity of
fertility, hoping for aid in conceiving a child.

### Domain Power

Deities gain power over
specific domains based on the nature of the requests they receive. If a
deity frequently receives offerings with requests for rain, they gain
power over the Domain of Water. This system leads to several notable
characteristics:

1. Domains are not exclusive to a single deity.
2. Deities may compete for influence over the same domain.
3. Contradictory requests can lead to complex power dynamics within a domain.

### Fulfillment of Requests

For this system to function,
deities must fulfill the requests associated with offerings. If mortals
perceive that their offerings are not resulting in the desired outcomes,
they may cease making offerings to that deity, potentially diminishing
the deity's power over time.

---
## Power Acquisition and Usage

## Offering Point System

Deities in Faerun acquire power through a point system based on offerings. Different types of offerings provide different amounts of points:

* Simple prayer or thought: 1 point
* Small material offering (food, flowers, coins): 5 points
* Significant time commitment (hour-long ritual, day of fasting): 10 points
* Valuable material offering (gems, precious metals, rare ingredients): 50 points
* Major sacrifice (rare items, life-changing vows, acts of extreme devotion): 100 points
* Life sacrifice (extremely rare and often considered taboo): 1000 points

Examples of offerings for various deity types:

* War deity: Weapons, victory spoils, battle scars
* Knowledge deity: Books, discoveries, solved puzzles
* Nature deity: Seeds, animal care, environmental protection
* Death deity: Funeral rites, memorials, last breaths
* Evil deity: Pain infliction, corruption acts, stolen goods

### Power Pool Mechanics

Each deity maintains a Power Pool for each of their domains. These pools operate as follows:

1. Accumulation: Points from offerings are added to the appropriate domain's Power Pool.
2. Decay: Power Points naturally decay over time at a rate of 1% per year.
3. Usage: When a deity uses power from a domain, points are deducted from the pool.
4. Inactivity: A deity not receiving worship for centuries will gradually lose power and potentially fade into obscurity or death.

### Access by Minor Deities and Priests

Minor deities and priests can access a portion of their patron deity's Power Pool:

* Minor deities: Can access up to 10% of the main deity's Power Pool.
* Priests Miracle Casting:
  + 1st rank spell/miracle: 1 Power Point
  + 5th rank spell/miracle: 5 Power Points
  + 9th rank spell/miracle: 10 Power Points

### Power Usage Examples by Domain

For each domain, examples are provided at different power levels: Low (100 points), Medium (1,000 points), High (10,000 points), and Cosmic (100,000 points). All domains include the ability to create an avatar at appropriate point costs. Avatar creation costs vary based on power and duration, ranging from 1000 points for a weak, short-lived avatar to 100,000 points for a godlike, long-lasting avatar. If the avatar is destroyed, the invested points are lost.

## Divine Planes and Soul Mechanics

# Divine Planes and Soul Mechanics

## Outer/Divine Planes

1. Structure:
   * Each deity possesses their own Divine Plane, a realm that embodies their domains and nature.
   * These planes are separate from the Material Plane and other planes of existence.
2. Power Dynamics:
   * Within their own Divine Plane, a deity has full access to their domain powers without expending Power Points (PP).
   * The magnitude of powers a deity can use in their plane is limited by their current PP total in that domain. (e.g., they can't use 1000-point powers if they only have 100 PP in that domain)
   * Deities have no power in other deities' planes, maintaining a balance of power.
3. Interaction with Material Plane:
   * Deities cannot directly manifest on the Material Plane.
   * They can only interact with the Material Plane by using their Domain Powers, expending PP as previously established.

## Soul Claiming and Divine Beings

1. Soul Claiming Process:
   * When a mortal dies, their soul becomes eligible for claiming by deities.
   * The deity to whom the deceased gave the most offerings during their lifetime has the right to claim the soul.
2. When a soul is claimed and
   transformed into a Divine Being, their power is determined by the total
   offerings they made during their lifetime. This power can be expressed
   in terms of Pathfinder 2e levels: Divine Being Level = √(Total Lifetime Offerings / 100) rounded down. Minimum level is 1, maximum level is 20
3. Interpretation:
   * A level 1-5 Divine Being might be a minor celestial or fiend (Messengers, minor helpers)
   * A level 6-10 Divine Being could be equivalent to a powerful [[Outsider]] (Emissaries, skilled agents)
   * A level 11-15 Divine Being might be on par with demigods or archangels (Champions, leaders of divine armies)
   * A level 16-20 Divine Being would be incredibly powerful, close to lesser deities in strength (Demigods, direct representatives of the deity)
4. Divine Being Capabilities:
   * These beings can travel between [[Divine Planes]], serving as messengers or warriors for their deity.
   * Their power level determines their effectiveness in various tasks and combat situations.

## Impact on Divine Economy

1. Incentive for Worship:
   * This system encourages mortals to be consistent in their offerings to a particular deity if they wish for a powerful afterlife.
2. Divine Conflict:
   * Deities may compete for the souls of powerful or influential mortals, potentially leading to divine interventions or conflicts.
3. Balance of Power:
   * Deities with more devoted worshippers will have more powerful Divine Beings, potentially shifting the balance of power in the [[Divine Planes]].
4. Material Plane Influence:
   * While deities can't directly manifest in the Material Plane, their influence through domain powers and the promise of a powerful afterlife can significantly shape mortal societies and beliefs.

## Practical Applications

1. For Deities:
   * Carefully manage PP expenditure to maintain the ability to use powerful abilities in their own plane.
   * Cultivate devoted worshippers to ensure a steady supply of powerful Divine Beings.
2. For Mortals:
   * Choose carefully which deity to primarily worship, as it will determine their afterlife.
   * Balance offerings between immediate divine assistance and long-term afterlife prospects.
3. For Divine Beings:
   * Serve their deity faithfully to potentially gain more power or responsibilities.
   * Navigate the complex politics of the [[Divine Planes]] as representatives of their deity.
