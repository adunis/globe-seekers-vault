**Cleric Outfit**:
Tiamatâ€™s clerics wear extravagant robes adorned with red, gold, and
black dragon motifs. Their flails are shaped like the many heads of a
dragon, each representing a different chromatic dragon color. They often
wear gold jewelry and dragon-scale armor, symbolizing their devotion to
power, wealth, and dominance.
