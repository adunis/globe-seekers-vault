An elder evil is not merely a powerful being; it is a fundamental force of cosmic disruption. These entities predate the gods themselves, existing in the primordial chaos before the Weave took hold. Imagine a being whose very existence predates the concept of life and death, whose thoughts are anathema to the natural order. The Aboleth Patron embodies certain aspects of an Elder Evil, seeking to ascend to godhood and control reality itself. His manipulation of factions like the Kraken King, the Wyrmclaw Alliance, and the [[[[Necrocracy of Thay]]]] demonstrates a calculated approach to upsetting the delicate balance of power. This ambition mirrors the behaviour of ancient beings seeking to reshape reality for their own incomprehensible purposes

.

Elder Evils are not always active. Some slumber in forgotten corners of the multiverse, their power contained by ancient seals or the vigilance of forgotten guardians. Others might exist as disembodied consciousnesses, whispering through the fabric of reality, subtly influencing events to orchestrate their return. The Netherese Globes

, with their connection to a potentially ancient and malevolent entity like Piscaethces, could be seen as remnants of an Elder Evil's power, waiting to be exploited. Their ability to absorb divine essence and manipulate magic points to a level of power that transcends mortal comprehension.

The sources, while not directly defining 'Elder Evil', paint a picture of a world threatened by forces beyond mortal understanding. These forces seek to undermine the existing order, potentially opening the door to realms of chaos and madness like the [location:6929103], where entities like the Aboleth originate. This potential connection to the Far Realm is further supported by the existence of locations like the Heavenly Staircase of Selune

, a site where gods can manifest in their true forms and mortals might ascend to godhood. The sources suggest that the Patron's goal is to exploit this very location, using a [[[[Netherese Globe]]]] to achieve his ambition. Such an act could have catastrophic consequences, blurring the lines between the Material Plane and the chaotic dimensions beyond.
