### The Ancient Empires and Cultural Foundations

Long ago, Faerûn was home to an expansive **Ancient Elven Empire** that controlled vast territories and thrived on arcane knowledge and harmony with nature. This empire spanned the lands now held by the **Anelectory of Cormyr**. However, internal strife and external pressures eventually dismantled this empire. As the power of the elves waned, they were forced to flee their ancestral lands. Many elves sought refuge on the **Green Isle** or within the **High Forest**, where they split into two distinct subcultures: the **High Elves** on [[The Green Isle]], devoted to preserving ancient knowledge, and the **Wood Elves** in the High Forest, who embraced a more harmonious relationship with nature. Others retreated to the depths of the earth, transforming over time into the Drow, a reclusive and secretive people adapted to the darkness of the Underdark.

On the remnants of this elven empire, the **Anelectory of Cormyr** was eventually established, blending human cultures with the legacy and ruins of the elven civilization that once stood there. This new nation retained aspects of elven culture, especially in its reverence for chivalry, nature, and the arcane, and was heavily influenced by Tethyrian traditions shaped by their former elven allies.

In the northern regions, a powerful **Ancient Dwarven Empire** once held sway over the lands now controlled by the **Kingdom of Damara**. Renowned for their mastery of stonework and fortification, the dwarves built vast [[Cities]], roads, and subterranean halls. Although the empire has long since vanished, Damara’s [[Cities]] and infrastructure still stand on dwarven foundations. Today, the Damarians incorporate dwarven ruins into their own [[Cities]], honoring the dwarves’ architectural legacy while building a society centered on faith, resilience, and defense against dark forces.

### The Netheril Empire and the Formation of the Inner Sea

At the heart of Faerûn once lay the **Nether Empire**, an empire of powerful mages who wielded arcane knowledge beyond imagination. Centered where the **Inner Sea** now exists, Netheril was known for floating [[Cities]] and incredible magical feats. However, the empire’s thirst for power led to a catastrophic event known as the **Netheril Fall**. During this disaster, a massive arcane explosion tore through the land, causing the collapse of Netheril’s floating [[Cities]] and leaving a huge crater that filled with water over time, becoming the Inner Sea. The fall of Netheril not only reshaped Faerûn’s geography but also sent shockwaves across the land, influencing many cultures in its wake.

Refugees from Netheril fled to various regions, with a significant number seeking sanctuary in the distant south in what is now known as **Halruaa**. These exiled mages brought their arcane knowledge with them, merging it with local traditions and founding a unique, magic-infused society. Halruaan culture, deeply influenced by Netheril’s legacy, became known for its dedication to arcane research, innovation, and mastery of magical technology, including flying ships and other arcanapunk advancements. Over time, Halruaa evolved into a mystical kingdom where *Mystra*, *Gond*, and *Lathander* are widely revered, representing the pursuit of magic, invention, and progress.

### The Current Conflict: The War Between the Wyrmclaw Empire and Akanul

In the south, the **Tri-Draconate Empire of the Wyrmclaw** has recently found itself in open conflict with the **[[Tetrasultanate of Akanul]]**. The Wyrmclaw Empire, which values power, sovereignty, and respect for nature’s raw force, has clashed with Akanul over territory and resources. The two nations have fundamentally different outlooks: Wyrmclaw worships gods like *Tiamat*, *Talos*, and *Silvanus*, revering strength, chaos, and adaptation, while Akanul, with its elemental heritage, is devoted to *Anhur*, *Mystra*, and *Waukeen*, focusing on honor, magic, and commerce.

This ongoing war has destabilized the southern region, affecting trade routes and causing political tension among nearby nations. Akanul, a vibrant land with strong elemental ties and a merchant-driven economy, struggles to withstand the Wyrmclaw’s aggressive expansionist ambitions. The conflict has also drawn the attention of neighboring powers, including Amn and Cormyr, which have been pulled into diplomatic and military support roles to either stabilize the region or leverage the war for their own strategic interests.

### Recent Historical Alliances and the Lasting Legacy of Ancient Civilizations

As the world moved on from these ancient empires, new alliances and rivalries formed. **Cormyr** and **Sembia** solidified their ties through trade and mutual respect for tradition, forming a powerful economic and military alliance. In the north, **Damara** and **Aglarond** allied to resist the dark influence of the **[[Necrocracy of Thay]]**, which has continued to expand its necromantic practices and ambitions.

Meanwhile, the **[[Free City of Procampur]]** and **[[Mercantocracy of Amn]]** have maintained their own forms of independence, with [[Procampur]] focusing on neutrality and trade, while Amn has become a society structured around wealth and ambition. [[Procampur]]’s neutrality has allowed it to mediate between nations, while Amn’s social hierarchy and dark elegance have given it a unique role in Faerûn’s complex web of alliances and enmities.

Thus, Faerûn today is a tapestry woven from the remnants of ancient empires and the rise of new powers, each shaped by its unique cultural heritage, the gods they worship, and the land itself. The ongoing conflict between Wyrmclaw and Akanul, along with the shadow of the Netheril Fall and the influence of elven and dwarven ruins, continues to shape the world and the destiny of its people.
