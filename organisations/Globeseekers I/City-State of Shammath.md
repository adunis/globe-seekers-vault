[[Sshamath]]
is a subterranean city introduced in Session 7 of your campaign. It is a
lawless and dangerous place, rife with intrigue and hidden agendas.
Your players arrive in the city via a portal hidden beneath a butcher
shop.

Exile and Teleportation Circles

The sources you provided suggest that owning a teleportation circle connected to the surface is a serious crime in [[Sshamath]],
potentially leading to exile. This law highlights the city's
isolationist nature and its desire to remain hidden from the outside
world. Exile from [[Sshamath]] is considered a fate worse than death for
many, particularly those who fear capture by the priestesses of
[[Menzoberranzan]], the traditional enemy of [[Sshamath]].

Power Struggles and the [[Black Spider]]'s Role

Yilvynna, a Drow encountered by the party, reveals that [[Sshamath]] is embroiled in a power struggle between the schools of Necromancy and Conjuration.

The [[Black Spider]], a rogue Drow wizard from [[Menzoberranzan]], is allied
with the School of Necromancy and is seeking to gain power in the city.
He is particularly interested in obtaining a magical item known as the
Brain Drill, which is capable of reading thoughts, from the School of
Conjuration.

Session Locations

Several
sessions of your campaign take place in [[Sshamath]]. These sessions
highlight the city's dangers and the various factions that vie for power
within its shadowy depths. The party explores a butcher shop, an
abandoned apartment, and the area around Zorb, the central pillar of the
city.

 They also encounter various inhabitants, including a two-headed shaman, Duergar, and a Mind Flayer.

Beyond the Sources

Your
sources only offer glimpses into [[Sshamath]], focusing on locations and
events directly related to the players' actions. To enhance your
understanding of [[Sshamath]] and its role in the Forgotten Realms, I can
provide some additional information from outside your sources, which you
may wish to independently verify:

●

In the Forgotten Realms setting, [[Sshamath]] is a prominent Drow city located deep beneath the Underdark. It is known for its treacherous politics, its connection to the demonic Abyss, and its fierce rivalry with [[Menzoberranzan]].

●

The city is ruled by a council of powerful Drow houses, each with its own agenda and ambitions.
These houses are constantly scheming and plotting against each other,
making [[Sshamath]] a place of constant intrigue and betrayal.

●

[[Sshamath]] is also a major centre for the worship of Lolth, the Drow goddess of spiders. The city's temples are filled with dark rituals and sacrifices, reflecting the Drow's cruel and bloodthirsty nature.

Conclusion

[[Sshamath]]
is a complex and fascinating location, full of potential for adventure
and intrigue. Your campaign utilises the city as a setting for several
sessions, highlighting its dangers and the power struggles that take
place within its walls. While the sources provide a foundation for
understanding [[Sshamath]], you may wish to draw on additional resources
from the Forgotten Realms setting to further develop the city and its
inhabitants for your players.
