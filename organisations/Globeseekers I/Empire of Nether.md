The Empire of Netheril was a powerful human empire that existed in ancient Faerûn. Netheril was known for its advanced magic, particularly its mastery of flying [[Cities]].

●

The Netherese were known to despise deities. They demonstrated this disdain by desecrating statues of Umberlee in her temple on the Island of Kora-Kora. They decapitated statues depicting her triton form and replaced their heads with amulets bearing the three-eyed symbol of the Netherese Empire.

●

The elves of Cormanthyr, before their empire fell, were enemies of Netheril. These elves possessed knowledge of how to destroy and disable even the most potent Netherese artefacts.

●

The Empire of Netheril ultimately fell because of its misuse of magic.

●

A powerful mage named Zathar hid his [[Spirit]] and body in a tomb on the Island of Kora-Kora after the fall of Netheril. Zathar offers to share the locations of several Netherese artefacts in exchange for being resurrected.

Netherese Globes

○

Netherese Globes are powerful artefacts scattered across the planes of existence that can manipulate magic.

○

They were originally created by a council of Netherese archmages to protect themselves from the deities, whom they saw as a threat to their power.

○

Ironically, the use of the Globes ultimately led to the fall of Netheril.

○

There have been at least three documented attempts throughout history to use the Globes for divine ascension:

■

339 DR: Archmage Vulthar attempted to use a Globe for divine ascension but failed. This attempt caused the creation of the Desert of Vulthar.

■

167 DR: The Witch-Queen of Dambrath partially succeeded in using a Globe for divine ascension but went mad.

■

1001 DR: The Council of Three was stopped from using the Globes before they could complete the ritual.

○

Each of these attempts prompted Selûne to relocate the Celestial Stairway to prevent further misuse.

○

The Aboleth Xul'koroth is attempting to gather the five Netherese Globes to activate the Celestial Stairway in the Tear of Selûne and ascend to godhood.

●

Types of rituals that can be performed with Netherese Globes:

○

The Ritual of Divine Absorption (Karsus's Hunger): This ritual takes its name from Karsus, the archmage of Netheril who attempted to steal the power of the goddess of magic, Mystra. While his attempt failed, his research laid the groundwork for the creation of the Globes. The full ritual is fragmented into three parts. The ritual must be performed on the Celestial Stairway during an astronomical alignment called the "Convergence of Spheres," which occurs once every 100 years.

○

The Ritual of Divine Ascension (Echo of Creation): This ritual requires a Globe containing the essence of at least one deity. The ritual must be performed on the Celestial Stairway during twilight. The number of worshippers required to perform the ritual increases for each additional divine domain the ritualist wishes to acquire. The ritual is contained in the Netherese Codex of Ascension.
