The Githzerai State is a society formed by the Githzerai people. The sources provide several details about this state, particularly through descriptions of [[Zerthadlun]], a Githzerai city located in the plane of Limbo.

[[Zerthadlun]]

●

[[Zerthadlun]] is characterised by its floating towers.

●

The city was likely created by the Githzerai's ability to manipulate chaotic energy using their minds. This ability allows them to create safe zones within Limbo, a plane permeated by chaotic energy that inflicts damage upon contact.

●

The city features a casino called [[The Nexus of Fortuna]]. Fortunes are known to change rapidly within the Nexus.

●

[[Zerthadlun]] also has a Palazzo della Sicurezza. This building acts as a hub where Githzerai can receive assignments, including missions against their sworn enemies, the Githyanki.

●

The Palazzo della Giustizia, another significant location within [[Zerthadlun]], is where figures like Zetlana, the city's Mastromente, preside over matters of justice. It was here that the Githzerai uncovered a plot involving Vrexxis, a Githyanki spy who owned [[The Nexus of Fortuna]].

●

The sources mention [[Morun Tag]], a character who purchased property in [[Zerthadlun]] and constructed a portal connecting it to his manor in [[Procampur]], a city on the Material Plane. This suggests that [[Zerthadlun]] has a functioning economy and the ability to interact with other planes of existence.

●

Bounty hunting is a viable profession in [[Zerthadlun]]. [[Korgak]], for instance, successfully completed three bounties in ten days, earning a million gold coins.

●

[[Zerthadlun]] is not completely safe from the dangers of Limbo. The presence of creatures like Ancient Behirs and Abyssal Beholders indicates that threats exist even within a protected city.

●

The city has an Office of Job Placement that assists skilled individuals in finding employment opportunities across various planes of existence. [[B.B]]., known for his discretion and reliability, received job offers ranging from bodyguard to Archon of Mount Celestia to an elite trainer for a fire elemental city-state's defence force.

Githzerai Society

●

Githzerai society values displays of power and dominance. When Vordekai presented Githzerai guards with Githyanki body parts as a gruesome gift, they reacted positively.

●

The Githzerai state is not entirely homogenous. Despite its rigid structure, the society has outcasts and individuals pursuing forbidden knowledge. One example is the Githzerai alchemist who researched weapons capable of rapidly aging Githyanki.

●

The Githzerai are at war with the Githyanki.

 This conflict extends even into the plane of Limbo, as seen in the case of Vrexxis, the Githyanki spy operating [[The Nexus of Fortuna]].

●

Azara, a promising Githzerai monk and magus, betrayed her people by delivering a [[Netherese Globe]] to the Githyanki, suggesting possible internal divisions or manipulation by external forces within Githzerai society.

The sources portray the Githzerai state as a haven of order within the unpredictable realm of Limbo. Despite providing opportunities for wealth and advancement, the society seems to place a high value on power and ruthlessness. The ongoing conflict with the Githyanki remains a defining aspect of their existence, as does their mastery of mental discipline for survival in the chaotic plane they inhabit.
