The sources offer glimpses into various aspects of [[Morun Tag]]'s crafting business, though they do not provide a comprehensive overview of its structure and operations. Based on the available information, it appears that his business model leverages a combination of enslaved labour, strategic partnerships, and innovative technologies.

Enslaved Labour: [[Morun Tag]] exploits enslaved goblins and deep [[Gnomes]] to fuel his production of magic items and devices.

●

Deep Gnome (Svirfneblin) Inventors: [[Morun Tag]] purchased ten deep gnome inventors as slaves

. Known for their ingenuity and skill in crafting, these [[Gnomes]] are forced to create items for [[Morun Tag]]'s profit. They operate in teams alongside [[Goblin]] saboteurs, targeting [[Morun Tag]]'s enemies and working on projects that contribute to his wealth

.

●

[[Goblin]] Labour: While the sources do not explicitly mention [[Goblin]] involvement in the crafting process, it is plausible that [[Morun Tag]] utilizes his [[Goblin]] slaves for tasks like mining raw materials, transporting goods, or performing menial labour within his workshops. Given his reliance on [[Goblin]] slaves for other purposes, it is likely that they play a role in supporting the overall production process.

●

Ethical Implications: The use of enslaved labour raises significant ethical concerns. [[Morun Tag]]'s business model thrives on exploitation, depriving individuals of their freedom and autonomy for his own financial gain.

Strategic Partnerships and Collaborations:

●

[[Goblin]] Saboteurs and Deep Gnome Engineers: The sources highlight [[Morun Tag]]'s use of combined teams of [[Goblin]] saboteurs and deep gnome engineers

. These teams work together to achieve his goals, suggesting a degree of collaboration and potentially even a share of the profits for the goblins involved.

●

Business Contacts: [[Morun Tag]] cultivates relationships with individuals who can contribute to his business ventures, such as Zahir al-Safir, a Calishite pirate merchant

. These connections provide him with access to resources, markets, and potentially even protection.

Technological Innovation:

●

Micro Cube Combiners: [[Morun Tag]] invests in crafting devices called "Micro Cube Combiners," which appear to be modular contraptions that can be combined in various ways to create specific effects

. These devices likely contribute to his production of traps, sabotage tools, and potentially even magic items.

●

Iron Golem Poison Canisters: The sources describe [[Morun Tag]]'s study of "Iron Golem Poison Canisters," which he salvaged and reverse-engineered to create powerful devices based on the golem's poisonous breath

. This demonstrates his interest in acquiring and adapting existing technologies to further his own goals.

Production and Sales:

●

Crafting During Downtime: [[Morun Tag]] encourages his deep gnome inventors to craft items for sale during their downtime

. This suggests a continuous production cycle aimed at generating income and expanding his inventory of magic items.

●

Sales Through Agents: [[Morun Tag]] employs agents to sell his crafted items, utilizing a network of individuals to distribute his products and reach a wider customer base

.

Relocation to Limbo:

●

Portal to [[Zerthadlun]]: [[Morun Tag]] establishes a portal connecting his manor in [[Procampur]] to a property he purchased in [[Zerthadlun]], a Githzerai city in Limbo

. This move suggests a desire to operate in a less regulated environment with potential access to new resources and markets.

Uncertainties and Gaps:

●

Specific Crafting Processes: The sources do not detail the specific methods [[Morun Tag]] uses to craft magic items. It is unclear whether he relies solely on the skills of his enslaved deep [[Gnomes]] or if he possesses personal knowledge of enchanting or other magical techniques.

●

Scale and Reach: The scope and reach of [[Morun Tag]]'s business remain unclear. It is unknown how many items he produces, the extent of his distribution network, or the full range of products he offers.

Overall, the sources depict [[Morun Tag]] as a cunning and ambitious entrepreneur who utilizes a combination of enslaved labour, technological innovation, and strategic partnerships to build his crafting empire. His relocation to Limbo suggests a desire to further expand his operations and potentially operate outside the constraints of conventional laws and regulations. However, his reliance on slavery raises significant ethical concerns about the cost of his success.
