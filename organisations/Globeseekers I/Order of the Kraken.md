The Order of the Kraken, led by the formidable Kraken King, is a powerful pirate faction wielding considerable influence within the Sea of Fallen Stars. The sources depict them as a ruthless and ambitious force seeking to expand their dominion and disrupt the existing power dynamics of the region.

Goals and Ambitions

●

The Order of the Kraken seeks to establish control over the Sea of Fallen Stars. Their actions, including the capture of key locations like Alaor and the Prespur Islands, indicate a strategic approach to expanding their territory and influence.

●

They are actively involved in gathering Netherese Globes. Their leader, the Kraken King, possesses the [[Netherese Globe]] of Water, which grants him control over sea creatures and the ability to orchestrate devastating storms and maritime attacks.

This suggests a connection to the Patron, Xul'koroth, who orchestrates the collection of these powerful artefacts.

●

The sources hint at the Order's involvement in a larger plan to destabilise Faerûn and prepare for an Aboleth invasion. This aligns with the Patron's ultimate goal of achieving godhood and restoring Aboleth dominance.

Tactics and Resources

●

The Kraken King's ability to control the seas through the [[Netherese Globe]] of Water grants him a significant tactical advantage. He can summon colossal Krakens, unleash devastating storms, and command a vast array of sea creatures.

●

The Order utilises fear and intimidation to subdue their enemies and expand their control. The Kraken King's reputation as a merciless pirate lord precedes him, instilling fear in those who oppose him.

●

They employ a network of spies and informants, such as [[Malaria]], the Wererat Queen, who operates within [[Airspur]] and manipulates events to the Kraken King's advantage.

Impact on the Campaign Setting

●

The Order of the Kraken's activities have destabilised the Sea of Fallen Stars, disrupting trade routes and creating a sense of fear and uncertainty among coastal nations.

●

Their actions have prompted responses from various factions, including:

○

Sembia, Cormyr, and Vesperin: These nations have increased their naval patrols and sought alliances to counter the Kraken King's aggression.

○

Akanul: Engaged in a war with the Wyrmclaw, Akanul finds itself vulnerable to the Kraken King's advances.

○

[[Procampur]]: This important city has faced direct attacks from the Kraken King, highlighting the Order's willingness to target significant locations.

●

The Order's alliance with Xul'koroth and their role in gathering Netherese Globes place them at the heart of the campaign's central conflict.

Key Figures

●

The Kraken King: The mysterious leader of the Order, wielding immense power through the [[Netherese Globe]] of Water.

●

[[Malaria]]: The Wererat Queen, acting as a spy and manipulator for the Kraken King.

●

Captain Daelar Darkshadow: The Kraken King's right-hand man, described as a ruthless pirate with a fearsome reputation.

The Order of the Kraken presents a significant challenge to the established order within the Sea of Fallen Stars. Their ambition, ruthlessness, and connection to Xul'koroth make them a formidable adversary for those seeking to maintain balance and stability within the region. Their actions have far-reaching consequences, shaping the political landscape and influencing the decisions of other factions. The campaign's outcome will likely hinge on whether the players can successfully counter the Order's ambitions and disrupt their alliance with the Aboleth mastermind
