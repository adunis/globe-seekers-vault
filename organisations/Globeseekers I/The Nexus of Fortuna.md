The casino in Limbo is called the Nexus of Fortuna. It is located in [[Zerthadlun]], a Githzerai city known for its floating towers.

 The Nexus of Fortuna is a place where fortunes can shift dramatically, as evidenced by [[Morun Tag]]'s experience.

Here is what the sources reveal about the Nexus of Fortuna:

●

Ownership: Vrexxis, a suspected Githyanki spy, was the owner of the Nexus of Fortuna. After the adventurers exposed and eliminated him, the casino was auctioned off for 200 million gold coins.

●

Clientele: The casino attracts a diverse clientele, including powerful entities from various planes of existence. [[Morun Tag]]'s gambling success at the Nexus of Fortuna attracted the attention of a Balor, an ancient gold dragon, a powerful Illithid archmage, a Banshee Queen, an Alpha Behir, a Noble Djinni, an Ancient Vampire, a millennial Kraken, a Githyanki warlord, and a Fallen Celestial.

●

[[Morun Tag]]'s Success: [[Morun Tag]], a [[Derro]] sapper rogue, won a fortune of 2 million gold coins at the Nexus of Fortuna in just ten days.

His success demonstrates the casino's potential for both great gains and losses.

●

[[B.B]].'s Job Offer: After proving his discretion and reliability, [[B.B]]. was offered several job opportunities through [[Zerthadlun]]'s Office of Job Placement, including a position as an elite trainer for a fire elemental city-state’s defence force.

This suggests that the casino, as part of the city’s economy, may have connections to these interplanar employers.

The sources do not provide specific details about the games offered at the Nexus of Fortuna or the casino's overall atmosphere. However, given its location in the chaotic plane of Limbo and its clientele of powerful beings, it is likely a place of high stakes and unpredictable outcomes.
