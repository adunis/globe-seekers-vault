Neverwinter, Baldur's Gate, and Waterdeep are collectively known as "Triportum of the Sword Coast" each playing a vital role in the regionâ€™s identity and independence.

* **Neverwinter** is introduced as [[Gundren]] Rockseeker's home, reflecting its reputation as a center of trade and adventure. Known for its vibrant trade networks and close connection to the Neverwinter Wood, the city serves as a hub where merchants and adventurers gather. Despite its prosperity, Neverwinter has faced challenges like volcanic eruptions and political turmoil, adding depth to its storied history.
* **Baldur's Gate** appears as the base of the [[Red Sashes]], a criminal organization involved in kidnapping and soul trafficking. This sprawling metropolis is a powerhouse on the Sword Coast, famed for its commercial influence, political intrigue, and notorious Flaming Fist mercenary company. The mention of the [[Red Sashes]] in your campaign highlights Baldur's Gate's darker side, where corruption and opportunity are intertwined.
* **Waterdeep**, though not directly referenced in the campaign events, remains the largest and most influential city on the Sword Coast. Known as the City of Splendors, it is often regarded as the beating heart of the Forgotten Realms. Though the current campaign focuses on other [[Cities]], Waterdeep could be integrated through characters with connections to the city or by having the adventurers travel there for new plotlines.
