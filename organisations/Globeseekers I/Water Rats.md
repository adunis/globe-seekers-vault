Water Rats: A Faction of Mutant [[Genasi]]

The Water Rats are a faction of mutant [[Genasi]] of Water who reside in the sewers of [[Airspur]]. They are led by their queen, [[Malaria]], who is secretly a Wererat in the service of the Kraken King

.

●

Exiled and Rebellious: The Water Rats were exiled from the surface world and forced to live in the sewers of [[Airspur]]. The reasons for their exile are not explicitly stated in the sources, but it is suggested that their mutations and differences from other [[Genasi]] of Water led to their ostracization. They harbour resentment towards the Elemental Lords who rule [[Airspur]]

Alliance with the Kraken King: [[Malaria]], the Water Rat Queen, secretly serves the Kraken King and manipulates events in [[Airspur]] to his advantage. She uses the Water Rats to further his goals, even if it means putting them at risk

.

Encounter with the Players: The players encounter the Water Rats during their adventures in [[Airspur]]. They are initially captured by [[Miciotsu]], a vampire cat, and imprisoned in the sewers, where they meet [[Malaria]] and the Water Rats

. [[Malaria]] helps them escape and provides them with information about the Kraken King's plans.

●

Uncertain Future: The fate of the Water Rats after the players' encounter with them is unclear. It is possible that they continue to serve [[Malaria]] and the Kraken King, or they may seek to break free from their control and forge their own destiny.

The Water Rats are a complex faction with a history of exile and rebellion. Their alliance with the Kraken King highlights their willingness to challenge the status quo and seek power, even if it means aligning themselves with a dangerous and unpredictable force. Their fate remains uncertain, and their role in the campaign's unfolding events could be significant depending on the players' choices and actions.
