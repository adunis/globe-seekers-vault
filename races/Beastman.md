The Beastmen originate from **Verdantia (Verdant Heart)**, a Prime Plane rich in diverse ecosystems ranging from sprawling forests to living mountains. Over countless generations, Beastmen have evolved into various species such as Satyrs, Centaurs, and Tabaxi, each adapting uniquely to their specific environments. Unlike traditional carbon-based organisms, Beastmen possess a specialized protein called **Morphokin**, which enables their bodies to undergo gradual morphological changes over generations. This protein allows Beastmen to mimic the physical features of other creatures without altering their genetic makeup. For instance, a Beastman tribe living in close contact with orcs can develop [[Orc]]-like features such as tusks, broader frames, and rugged skin tones purely through the expression of Morphokin, enhancing their ability to blend into or intimidate neighboring orcish groups. This adaptive mimicry provides significant evolutionary advantages, such as improved survival in hostile environments, better integration into diverse ecosystems, and enhanced social interactions. By being able to assume the appearance of other creatures, Beastmen can avoid predation, establish symbiotic relationships, or assert dominance, thereby increasing their chances of thriving in Verdantiaâ€™s vibrant and ever-changing landscapes.
