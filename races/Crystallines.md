Hailing from the **Crystallia Crystal Expanse (Lux'crystallos)**, the Crystallines have uniquely evolved into various species, including gnomes and their kin. Unlike typical carbon-based lifeforms, Crystallines possess a silicon-based biology, granting them exceptional resilience and the ability to thrive in mineral-rich environments. Their cellular structures are composed of silicate compounds, providing a rigid yet flexible framework that supports their intricate crystalline forms. Crystallines have developed specialized molecules called **Luminite**, integrated into their circulatory systems, which enhance their ability to conduct and store energy derived from light. This allows them to efficiently harness and utilize the ambient light from their gemstone-rich surroundings for metabolic processes. Their brains are structured with highly organized crystalline neural networks, facilitating purely rational reasoning and the ability to perform complex mathematical calculations with ease. However, this specialized brain structure makes Crystallines less adept at handling irrational or emotionally driven thinking, often leading to challenges in social and emotional interactions. Additionally, Crystallines derive nutrients by absorbing mineral essences directly into their crystalline structures, allowing them to sustain their highly complex and energy-efficient bodies. This biochemical and neurological specialization enables Crystallines to excel in scientific and engineering pursuits, maintaining a cohesive and technologically advanced society within the gemstone-laden landscapes of Crystallia.
