From the elemental plane of **[[Draconis]] (The Dragonheart Plane)** emerge the Draconids, a formidable family of dragon-like beings that have evolved into diverse species, including Dragonborn and Kobolds. Their biology integrates both carbon-based and elemental essences, providing resilience against extreme environmental conditions. Draconids possess a specialized protein called **Pyrothene**, which binds elemental particles within their cells, allowing them to manipulate and store elemental energy. This biochemical adaptation enables Draconids to emit elemental particles as breath, such as fire, ice, or lightning, depending on their lineage. Additionally, Draconids have developed **Aerolith**, a lightweight yet strong compound integrated into their skeletal structures, enhancing their physical durability and enabling flight. Aerolith reduces the overall density of their bones without compromising strength, allowing Draconids to achieve and sustain flight with greater efficiency. Their skeletal systems are also embedded with small, aerodynamic structures that facilitate lift and maneuverability in the air. Draconids’ respiratory systems are adapted to filter and process elemental gases, supporting their ability to generate and control elemental breath. Their diets include elemental crystals and raw magical energy sources, which are metabolized using Pyrothene to maintain their unique physiology. Over time, Draconids have diversified into various species with slight variations in their elemental affinities and concentrations of Pyrothene, enabling each to specialize in different aspects of elemental manipulation and adapt to specific regions within [[Draconis]]’s volatile landscapes. These biological traits make Draconids both powerful and adaptable, allowing them to thrive in the extreme and dynamic environments of their home plane.
